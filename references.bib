  abstract = {There has always been a critical, emancipatory tradition within futures studies. Although those voices can still be heard, there has been a growing tendency for futures studies to be driven by more utilitarian needs in business and government. Whilst it is positive that futures thinking and research is increasingly valued within corporate and policy-making settings, much of that work appears to lack genuine plurality of worldviews and interests. The paper traces the changing contexts for futures research over the past 25 years. It argues that futures research needs to be viewed as part of the re-politicisation ‚Äì in the Habermasian sense ‚Äì of technocratic decision-making. It suggests that there are three particular reasons for revisiting the need for criticality in futures research: the increasing acknowledgement of systemic interrelatedness (ecological, social, economic), a growth in the forward-looking socio-economic paradigm that permeates both business and policy, and the challenge of theory development. Drawing on social theory and futures research, we suggest three pathways for revived critical futures research: socio-technical practices, future-oriented dialectics, and socio-economic imaginaries. As a result, the paper calls for development in futures studies that would dialectically integrate and overcome the dichotomy between instrumentalisation and (critical) theorising that can be currently understood as somewhat antagonistic. In order to find a balance between these antagonistic dimensions, futures research should be more engaged in enabling critique and revealing assumptions and interests.},

  abstract = {Has war fundamentally changed? If so, it may be time for reconsidering accepted moral standards for waging wars and for conduct in war. The new war thesis holds that wars have fundamentally altered since the end of the Cold War. Proponents such as Kaldor and Weiss hold that wars today are intrastate rather than interstate and are primarily being fought in the context of fragmented states.This thesis has acquired broad support, but it has also raised various criticisms. Taking account of empirical evidence, this review starts with an assessment of the various aspects of the thesis. The new war thesis has important normative implications. It challenges the traditional presumption that the sovereign state is the only authority capable of legitimate political violence. It also questions traditional justifications for humanitarian military intervention and for restrictions of human rights in the war against terrorism. These challenges are taken up by just war theorists. The review concludes that while the new wars thesis tends to overestimate the novelty of empirical trends, the just war theorists risk to overemphasize the need for ethical renewal.},

  abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to support sustainable and resilient urban planning. However, design and planning urban NBS targeted at the needs of the local context require knowledge about the causal relationships between NBS, ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC) This paper aims at contributing to this knowledge, by systematically identifying nexuses (i.e. qualitative links) between UC, ES and NBS, and describing plausible causal relationships. A conceptual UC-ES-NBS criteria framework was built, and used to guide a two-step systematic literature review on current UC and on the supply of ES by urban NBS. This was followed by a non-systematic literature review, which complemented the previous one by unveiling knowledge gaps on the biophysical and social processes and attributes on which specific ES classes depend. The non-systematic review was also used to identify additional NBS. The UC review identified 18 UC and 58 sub-challenges, and illustrated which UC were more studied, according to the type of literature and environmental and socio-economic attributes of urban contexts. The ES review led to the development of an urban NBS classification, and supported the identification of UC-ES and ES-NBS nexuses, which were analysed and classified into four groups of causal relationship. For the nexuses identified as direct plausible causal relationship, the main processes and attributes on which the supply of specific ES depend were pointed out. Relationships between UC, ES, NBS, processes, and attributes were represented in the form of network diagrams. Our results can be used to support urban policies aimed at mainstreaming NBS and as a basis to further understand UC-ES-NBS relationships.},

Using the Delphi method, an iterative approach that refines expert insights through multiple rounds, these studies provide foresight into AI‚Äôs technological advancements, societal impacts, and policy implications across various sectors. For example, Delphi studies in healthcare foresee significant advancements in AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine, while in manufacturing, AI is anticipated to enhance human-robot collaboration and supply chain optimization. AI‚Äôs impact on journalism and photography shows promise in automating processes and enriching immersive storytelling, although issues like data privacy and algorithmic bias are raised. This review emphasizes a primary focus on technology trajectories, examining anticipated developments and timelines, while also considering broader strategic foresight aspects. General challenges identified include equitable access, the need for robust data governance, and workforce upskilling to integrate AI responsibly. By synthesizing insights across these studies, we provide a structured overview of both opportunities and limitations in AI development, offering guidance for stakeholders to navigate AI's complexities and capitalize on its potential responsibly. In addition, we propose methodological recommendations, such as standardizing expert selection and diversifying perspectives to improve the quality of future Delphi studies.},

European attempts to ‚Äòsecure‚Äô or ‚Äòprotect‚Äô the borders have quite clearly failed, as politicians themselves increasingly recognise ‚Äì yet more of the same response is again rolled out in response to the escalating ‚Äòrefugee crisis‚Äô. Amid the deadlock, this article argues that we need to grasp the mechanics and logics of the European ‚Äòborder security model‚Äô in order to open up for a change of course. Through ethnographic examples from the Spanish-African borders, the article shows how the striving for border security under a prevailing emergency frame has generated absurd incentives, negative path dependencies and devastating consequences. At Europe's frontiers, an industry of border controls has emerged, involving European defence contractors, member state security forces and their African counterparts, as well as a range of non-security actors. Whenever another ‚Äòborder crisis‚Äô occurs, this industry grows again, feeding on its own apparent ‚Äòfailures‚Äô. This vicious cycle may be broken, the article concludes, once policy-makers start curtailing the economies of border security underpinning it ‚Äì yet the challenges are formidable as the industry retrenches along with the political response to the drama it has itself produced.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of a transport demand model‚Äôs predictions is inherently limited by the quality of the underlying data. This issue has been highlighted by the decline in response rates for transport surveys, which have traditionally served as the primary data source for estimating transport demand models. At the same time, mobile phone network data, not requiring active participation from subjects, have become increasingly available. However, some key trip and traveller characteristics enhancing the prediction power of the estimated models are not collected in mobile phone network data. In this paper we therefore investigate what can be gained from combining mobile phone network data with travel survey data, using the strengths of each data source, to estimate long-distance mode choice models. We propose and estimate a set of mode choice demand models on joint mobile phone network data and travel survey data. We show that combining the two data sources produces more credible estimates than models estimated on each data source separately. The travel survey should preferably include the variables: travel party size, cars per household licence, licence holding, in addition to origin, destination, mode, trip purpose, age, and gender of the respondent.},

  abstract = {I l√∏pet av de siste 30 √•rene har framveksten av Sametinget og andre samiske institusjoner l√∏ftet samepolitikken inn i en internasjonal urfolksdiskurs, hvor samiske rettigheter er styrket gjennom norsk st√∏tte til internasjonale konvensjoner. De tydeligste avtrykkene av samepolitikken finnes i Finnmark, der samer utgj√∏r en betydelig andel av befolkningen og Sametinget er lokalisert. Temaet for denne artikkelen er hvorvidt, og hvordan, samepolitikken p√•virker n√¶ringsutvikling og modernisering i nord. Artikkelen trekker opp tre hovedtyper for samepolitisk p√•virkning; i den ene ser vi p√• samepolitikkens tilknytning til mer interne samiske institusjoner og samfunnsliv; den andre gjelder samepolitikkens p√•kobling til lokal og regional samfunnsutvikling; og den tredje handler om samepolitikkens rolle i st√∏rre og mer globaliserte utviklingsprosesser. Et hovedfunn er at grensene mellom disse hovedtypene er blitt mer por√∏se. Samepolitikken spiller en stadig viktigere rolle i de √∏konomiske utviklingsprosessene i nord, b√•de de mer lokale og regionale og n√• ogs√• de stadig viktigere globaliserte √∏konomiske moderniseringsprosessene. Den √∏konomiske globaliseringen setter likevel et stadig sterkere press p√• samepolitikkens sterke tradisjonsorientering.

  abstract = {Indigenous peoples‚Äô relationship with mining involves tensions and conflicts that intensify in armed conflict and post-conflict environments. Studies of the intersection between mining, armed conflict and post-conflict peacebuilding portray Indigenous people as passive recipients post-conflict natural resource governance interventions. This paper challenges that perspective by demonstrating the active, highly organised and complex roles Indigenous people play in mineral resource governance in a post-agreement environment. Despite Colombian government interest in positioning high value mineral resource extraction as a platform for prosperity and peace, illegal gold mining has become a central source of finance for violent armed groups, and legal mining has been linked to threats to Indigenous rights. Many Indigenous communities in Colombia oppose mining. This paper examines Indigenous participation in natural resource governance concentrating on the resistance to certain forms of mining by the Nasa Indigenous people of North Cauca. It is based on an interpretative, layered ethnographic case study comprising archival research, interviews, and participant observation across various Nasa organisational and territorial domains. I find that the Nasa build on their strong moral and institutional frameworks for resistance to structure and implement a response to mining. I illustrate the Nasa's determinant role in post-conflict mining governance, as well as the moral tensions and dilemmas, and the risks the Nasa face in responding to mining in a violent context.},

  abstract = {Bus rapid transit (BRT) is considered the cheapest and fastest to implement mass transportation system compared to rail and tram. However, the implementation of BRT becomes complicated where there are incumbent paratransit service providers. In African cities, it has become mandatory to include these operators because they are the most extensive public transport service providers, employ many people, and make governments unpopular when excluded. In Accra, the government sought to implement BRT with the inclusion of incumbent paratransit operators but could only implement a conventional bus service. This article analyses the approach adopted to examine the reasons behind the inability to execute the planned BRT and draw lessons from the Ghana experience. This article adopted informal transportation and BRT characteristics based on the African experience to analyse the incorporation of incumbent paratransit operators in Ghana. The findings show the challenges the implementing agency encountered, resulting in a shift from BRT to a conventional bus. The underlying reason for the difficulty is the depth of change required by both paratransit operators and government institutions. Given the depth of change for capital investment, capacity, and governance reforms required, the paper recommends a more gradual BRT implementation approach in African cities.},

  abstract = {Runit Dome is an eighteen-inch thick concrete dome covering the buried nuclear waste from twenty-three atomic tests conducted by the US military in the 1940s and ‚Äô50s in Pikinni Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Known to locals as ‚ÄúThe Tomb,‚Äù it is leaking into the Pacific Ocean, in part because of the rising sea levels produced by global warming. Runit Dome brings climate change into direct relation with the legacies of nuclear imperialism in the Marshall Islands. This essay examines how Cold War securitization paradigms problematically inform the ecological management strategies developed by international policy-making entities such as the United Nations in the mid-twentieth century. While much literary and cultural scholarship on the rise of the nuclear age has focused on the concomitant rise of insecurities about body and environment under the duress of wartime, this essay crafts a different but intertwined history, showing how the transformation of the Pacific Ocean into a nuclear testing ground was parlayed into governmental projects for the remaking of life itself under the auspices of risk management. Military-backed and government-funded scientific experiments with nuclear and other weapons throughout the Pacific suggest a new phase in US imperial world-making, as the ecologies of waters, islands, sea creatures, and Pacific Islanders were turned into experimental materials for modeling shifts in social and ecological forms of governance. When environmental protections take for granted concepts such as enclosure, risk management, and Enlightenment formulations of property-owning and rights-bearing subjects, they manifest a settler environmentalism that too easily paves the way for capitalist regeneration under the aegis of eco-development projects rather than systemic change that understands human, nonhuman, and environment to be always already in relation. To break from perpetually extractive relations to land, sea, and life, Kathy Jet√±il-Kijiner‚Äôs video poem ‚ÄúAnointed‚Äù models how environmental futures must reckon with the causes of past and ongoing harm, and this essay concludes with a brief reflection on this poet-activist‚Äôs work.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The text covers the projection of the potential impact of the currently observed processes in the world economy on the international supply chains‚Äô geography. The economic effects of the pandemic, the modern trade war and Russia‚Äôs aggression towards Ukraine are considered key factors in changing this geography. When examining the importance of these factors, the matrix of three components of global supply chains is adopted: production centres, transport corridors and consumption centres. The reasoning allowed for rejecting both the scenario of maintaining the so-called hyper-globalisation and forming a bilateral system of two isolated and hostile economic systems. The presented arguments lead to the expectation of a mixed solution in the form of the simultaneous existence of a system of high globalisation and concentrated regional systems. The primary objective of this study is to identify and assess emerging trends in the configuration of international supply chains. On this basis, it is also intended to identify the most likely scenario for the future formation of the geography of international supply chains. The research used the literature study methodology and deductive inference of the consequences of the identified processes taken as premises for reasoning. The above-presented arguments lead to the assumption that the so-called hyper-globalisation is probably unsustainable. Various economic, political, technological and social factors make it impossible to sustain, let alone further develop, the current logic of shaping the global economic system. A world economy system with a hybrid structure is expected to emerge. The model of full globalisation will coexist with the model of a multilateral structure with a regional character centred around the main consumption and production centres. The factors determining the evolution of economic globalisation have been systematised. Their potential impact is described, and a likely scenario for change is presented. The achieved results can contribute to the design of economic policy at the level of individual countries and their groupings.},

It begins and ends with the Marshall Islands, at the crossroads of two great destructive forces: nuclear colonialism and the climate crisis. In the aftermath of sixty-seven US nuclear bomb "tests" visited upon the Marshall Islands, the concrete "dome" built on Runit Island by the US government was an act of erasure and a-void-ance‚Äîan attempt to contain and cover over plutonium remains and other material traces of the violence of colonial hospitality that live inside the Tomb (as the Marshallese call it). Taking the physicality of the hostility within hospitality seriously, and going into the core of the theory that produced the nuclear bomb, I argue that a radical hospitality‚Äîan infinity of possibilities for interrupting state sanctioned violence‚Äîis written into the structure of matter itself in its inseparability with the void.},

There is very little scholarly work done on this group, specifically on how their agency is deployed in the context of extreme undermining. Based on a case study of the activism of Vanessa Nakate, this paper analyses online interviews, media reports and social media interactions. The text was analysed thematically. The paper identifies three social binds (location, gender, and youth) that limit her activism. Importantly, the findings show how she deploys context-dependent agency to overcome those binds. The paper offers practical and theoretical insights for the study of African women climate activism. I argue that understanding and developing personal and political agency is essential for the sustainability of African women youth climate activism.},

Thus far most programs have focused on the immediate or underlying causes of conflict‚Äîto the relative neglect of state institutions.

  abstract = {Climate change poses diverse risks to the food security of individuals and communities in small Pacific Island states and offers a challenge to human rights. Climate change is likely to emphasize contemporary environmental trends and problems, ranging from land degradation, deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, to coastal erosion and the pollution of lagoons. Climate change will adversely affect food systems in the region, including the supply of food from both agriculture and fisheries, the ability of countries to import food through reduction in incomes and damage to infrastructure for food distribution, and the ability of households to purchase and utilize food. If tourism is also affected by climate change national and household incomes are likely to decline, fisheries may be first affected because of climatic impacts on coral reefs and sea temperatures and the mobility of marine species. Reduced agricultural production may be both long-term and short-term outcomes of particular climatic shocks, especially cyclones, with threats most likely to follow particular events rather than the outcome of mean changes in temperature or sea level. Coral atolls, and the atoll states of Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, are most at risk. Cyclones are likely to become more frequent and reduce the ability of food systems to recover. In multiple ways, climate change puts at risk the very basic and universal need for people in Pacific SIDS to have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food at all times.},

It contrasts and compares the different types of victim capital of these two groups and demonstrates how it resulted in varied changes in recognition and redress. While victims of sexual violence were recognized in the larger Bosnian entity in 2006, victims of torture remain unrecognized until today. In Republika Srpska, recognition came only in 2018. The gradual increase in women‚Äôs international salience and mobilization resources prior to 2006 combined with the rise of their moral authority explains the change in 2006. In contrast, victims of torture have leveraged their existing connections and organizational skills while their domestic authority and external salience fluctuated. The success of survivors of sexual violence in FBiH illustrates the ‚ÄòActivist Route‚Äô while the partial success of victims of torture and sexual violence in RS conforms to the ‚ÄòDomestic Pressure‚Äô scenario‚Äîhowever, in an increasingly closed political system. This chapter pays special attention to legal activism of both victim groups as well as the latest developments in access to redress.},

However, inclusion of the 1.5¬∞C long term temperature goal had been a long-fought struggle, led by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and resulted mainly from the Structured Expert Dialogue (SED) on the 2013-2015 review. This insight piece provides an overview of the results of the 2013-2015 review in light of the 1.5¬∞C temperature goal, and its importance for small island states. The piece also charts the convoluted course of the outcome of the 2013-2015 review in the Paris negotiations, the consequential recognition of the 1.5¬∞C goal in the agreement, and provides some initial thoughts of the adequacy of this provision in the Paris Agreement.},

  abstract = {The Munich Metropolitan Area (MMA) is embarking on becoming a more polycentric urban region. For long, the monocentric city model has provided strong explanatory power in understanding the location decisions of private households and firms. However, this model has been challenged by the emergence of large, polycentric city-regions. Increasing commute ranges and the spatial reorganization of economic activities show patterns of concentration and deconcentration at the same time but on different spatial scales. This paper gives an overview of and theorizing about the spatial driving forces and development within recent years. We use the interplay of agglomeration and network advantages to describe the spatial evolution of the MMA where new secondary centers emerge. Publicly available data and a large-scale web-survey provide the basis for descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses. We find ‚Äì maybe not surprisingly that still the same driving forces of the monocentric city model ‚Äì accessibility and economic competition ‚Äì are at work: the MMA‚Äôs public transport rail network still forms a radial and monocentric system, while the present use of space by inhabitants shows an increasingly polycentric pattern with explicit tangential relations. We then discuss the future spatio-functional development path of the MMA by pitching the current strong population and employment growth with its tendency toward metropolisation against an alternative development path with competing driving forces. We conclude with visualizing and discussing the alternative spatial development that simultaneously projects concentration, deconcentration, and dispersion dynamics.},

This article uses the case of the 1994 Rwandan genocide to investigate whether threats that stem from mass violence can also have a mobilizing effect. Drawing from interviews with 152 women in Rwanda, I reveal how threatening conditions created by the genocide and civil war initiated a grassroots mobilization process among women. This mobilization featured women founding and joining community organizations, engaging in new forms of claims making toward state institutions, and eventually running for political office. Two mechanisms facilitated this process: the social appropriation of feminine values for the reconceptualization of women as legitimate political actors, and the brokerage of connections between individual women, organizations, and government institutions by foreign actors. I conclude by suggesting that this mobilization served as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the meteoric rise of women in Rwanda‚Äôs politics.},

A common problem witnessed in both the developed and developing worlds is the inadequate complementarity among paratransit and conventional transit for maximized urban mobility provisions. Particularly in the Global South, such an inadequacy stems from the negative portrayal of paratransit whereas in the Global North paratransit remains underutilized. At this juncture, paratransit emerges as an important transportation segment that requires an in-depth understanding of its grained agenda demanding development. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary article-set on paratransit is constructed by involving the scholarships of transportation sciences, logistics management, planning and public policy, legal sciences, and general management. Thereby, this vast spread of literature [294 articles (1970‚Äì2023)] is excavated from two perspectives: (i) developed versus developing world's viewpoint, and (ii) understanding socio-economic planning issues at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. Resultantly, the agenda surrounding paratransit's development is outlined in layered themes. Three primary themes and thirteen subthemes granularize the strategic, tactical, and operational agenda of socio-economic planning in this regard. Furthermore, the review draws out diverse strategic pathways conceptualizing vital implications on how knowledge of paratransit can advance in the future.},

With its emphasis on making nature live, conservation marks a shift away from a sovereign form of rule that emphasized subduing and controlling nature; today, nature is ruled not by the sword but by science. Through a discussion of key concepts in conservation biology‚Äîpopulations in crisis; evolution and its future orientation; extinction as death that is necessary for life; and diversity as purity‚Äîwe illustrate the truth discourses, underlying logics, and calculative technologies by which distinctions within nonhuman life are made and made meaningful. We argue that conservation is biopolitical not just in that it moves from controlling individuals to statistically managing populations and species, but also in that it extends the racialized logic of abnormality in its core notions of biological diversity and purity. In the logics of conservation and race, life produces diversity, conceived as variety of biological kinds; within that diversity exist kinds that foster ongoing life, which should be maximized, and kinds that are threats, which should be let die in the name of life in general.},

  abstract = {European science policy (so-called Horizon 2020) is guided by Grand Societal Challenges (GSCs) with the explicit aim of shaping the future. In this paper we propose an innovative approach to the analysis and critique of Europe‚Äôs GSCs. The aim is to explore how speculative and creative fiction offer ways of embodying, telling, imagining, and symbolising ‚Äòfutures‚Äô, that can provide alternative frames and understandings to enrich the grand challenges of the 21st century, and the related rationale and agendas for ERA and H2020. We identify six ways in which filmic and literary representations can be considered creative foresight methods (i.e. through: creative input, detail, warning, reflection, critique, involvement) and can provide alternative perspectives on these central challenges, and warning signals for the science policy they inform. The inquiry involved the selection of 64 novels and movies engaging with notions of the future, produced over the last 150 years. Content analysis based on a standardised matrix of major themes and sub-domains, allows to build a hierarchy of themes and to identify major patterns of long-lasting concerns about humanity‚Äôs future. The study highlights how fiction sees oppression, inequality and a range of ethical issues linked to human and nature‚Äôs dignity as central to, and inseparable from innovation, technology and science. It concludes identifying warning signals in four major domains, arguing that these signals are compelling, and ought to be heard, not least because elements of such future have already escaped the imaginary world to make part of today‚Äôs experience. It identifies areas poorly defined or absent from Europe's science agenda, and argues for the need to increase research into human, social, political and cultural processes involved in techno-science endeavours.},

  abstract = {In the island states of Oceania, colonial power dynamics profoundly shape climate vulnerability and response. Largely as a result of their colonial history, island nations are dependent on outside funders to adapt to climate change, reproducing colonial subordination by depriving island states of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies. We empirically demonstrate the sovereignty-depriving effects of the current adaptation process through a case study from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). Recent scholarship suggests that, without swift and large-scale adaptation, RMI will be uninhabitable by mid-century, threatening a population-scale forced migration. Our research indicates that Marshallese leaders are committed to adapting in place in order to preserve national identity and sovereignty, but they view reliance on external funding as a major barrier to implementing the measures that could enable RMI to survive in the face of climate change. Marshallese decision-makers in this study perceive that aid institutions discount the existential implications of failing to pursue aggressive adaptation, assuming instead that migration is inevitable, economically rational, and even desirable. Such a proposal is particularly painful given the history of forced migration in RMI caused by U.S. nuclear weapons testing there. These neocolonial dynamics not only deprive island states of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies but also threaten permanent abrogation of national sovereignty and selfdetermination through loss of a habitable territory. To uphold global commitments to decolonization and human rights, our research indicates the need to return sovereignty over climate adaptation decision-making to affected states.},

  abstract = {Scientific reflexivity stands opposed to the narcissistic reflexivity of postmodern anthropology as well as to the egological reflexivity of phenomenology in that it endeavours to increase scientificity by turning the most objectivist tools of social science not only onto the private person of the enquirer but also, and more decisively, onto the anthropological field itself and onto the scholastic dispositions and biases it fosters and rewards in its members. 'Participant objectivation', as the objectivation of the subject and operations of objectivation, and of the latter's conditions of possibility, produces real cognitive effects as it enables the social analyst to grasp and master the pre-reflexive social and academic experiences of the social world that he tends to project unconsciously onto ordinary social agents. This does not mean that anthropologists must put nothing of themselves into their work, quite the contrary. Examples drawn from the author's own research (with special focus on field enquiries carried out concurrently in the far-away colony of Kabylia and in his home village in B√©arn) show how idiosyncratic personal experiences methodically subjected to sociological control constitute irreplaceable analytic resources, and that mobilizing one's social past through self-socio-analysis can and does produce epistemic as well as existential benefits. / La r√©flexivit√© scientifique s'oppose √† la r√©flexivit√© narcissique de l'anthropologie post-moderne tout autant qu'√† la r√©flexivit√© √©gologique de la ph√©nom√©nologie en ceci qu'elle s'efforce d'accro√Ætre la scientificit√© du savoir en retournant les outils les plus objectivistes de la science sociale non seulement sur la personne priv√©e du chercheur mais aussi et surtout sur le champ anthropologique lui-m√™me et sur les dispositions et les biais scolastiques que ce champ entretient et r√©compense chez ses membres. 'L'objectivation participante', en tant qu'objectivation du sujet et des op√©rations de l'objectivation ainsi que de ses conditions de possibilit√©, produit des effets cognitifs r√©els pour autant qu'elle permet √† l'analyste de saisir et de ma√Ætriser les exp√©riences sociales et acad√©miques pr√©-r√©flexives du monde social qu'il tend √† projeter inconsciemment sur les agents ordinaires. Ceci ne veut pas dire que les anthropologues ne doivent rien mettre d'eux-m√™mes dans leur travail, bien au contraire. Des exemples tir√©s des recherches de l'auteur (et notamment ses enqu√™tes de terrain conduites simultan√©ment dans la lointaine colonie de Kabylie et dans son village d'enfance du B√©arn) montrent comment des exp√©riences personnelles particuli√®res constituent des ressources analytiques irrempla√ßables d√®s lors qu'elles sont soumises √† un contr√¥le sociologique m√©thodique.

  abstract = {In trade among the members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), prices of raw materials are lower and those of manufactured goods higher than comparable world prices. Because the Soviet Union is a net exporter of raw materials to, and net importer of manufactures from, the other CMEA countries, it benefits less from CMEA trade than it would from trading with the rest of the world, and the other CMEA members benefit more. This redistribution of the gains from trade is generally seen as a form of subsidization. One explanation of these subsidies is that they represent Soviet payments for political and military benefits provided by East European regimes; another is that the subsidies compensate Eastern Europe for the economic burden imposed by central planning and extensive economic ties to the Soviet Union. I argue that neither of these explanations is consistent with the type of economic and political relations that one would expect of the Soviet and East European regimes. In their place I offer an alternative explanation based on the Heckscher-Ohlin model of comparative advantage. The distribution of CMEA subsidies is shown to reflect the distribution of gains from trade that would arise among any group of economies forming a preferential trading scheme. I also argue that the willingness of members to belong to CMEA, even at the expense of paying subsidies, is that CMEA can be viewed as a club that provides benefits to members while imposing costs that may to some extent be unequal and unpredictable.},

It presents a meta-analysis of the economic valuation literature and applies the estimated value function to assess the value of mangroves in Southeast Asia. We construct a database containing 130 value estimates, largely for mangroves in Southeast Asia. Values are standardised to US\$ per hectare per year in 2007 prices. The mean and median values are found to be 4185 and 239 US\$/ha/year respectively. The values of mangrove ecosystem services are highly variable across study sites due to, amongst other factors, the bio-physical characteristics of the site and the socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries of ecosystem services. We include explanatory variables in the meta-analysis to account for these influences on estimated mangrove values. A geographic information system (GIS) is used to quantify potentially important spatial variables, including the abundance of mangroves, the population of beneficiaries, and the density of roads in the vicinity of each study site. The meta-analytic value function is used to estimate the change in value of mangrove ecosystem services in Southeast Asia under a baseline scenario of mangrove loss for the period 2000‚Äì2050. The estimated foregone annual benefits in 2050 are US\$ 2.2 billion, with a prediction interval of US\$ 1.6‚Äì2.8 billion.},

  abstract = {Criminal justice policy faces the twin challenges of improving our crime reduction efforts while increasing public confidence. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that at least some measures popular with the public are counterproductive to greater crime reduction. How to achieve greater crime reduction without sacrificing public confidence? While restorative justice approaches offer a promising alternative to traditional sentencing with the potential to achieve these goals, they suffer from several serious obstacles, not least their relatively limited applicability, flexibility, and public support. Punitive restoration is a new and distinctive idea about restorative justice modeled on an important principle of stakeholding, which states that those who have a stake in penal outcomes should have a say about them. Punitive restoration is restorative insofar as it aims to achieve the restoration of rights infringed or threatened by criminal offences. Punitive restoration is punitive insofar as the available options for this agreement are more punitive than found in most restorative justice approaches, such as the option of some form of hard treatment. Punitive restoration sheds new light on how we may meet the twin challenges of improving our efforts to reduce reoffending without sacrificing public confidence, demonstrating how restorative practices can be embedded deeper within the criminal justice system.},

  abstract = {Proximity-based cities have attracted much attention in recent years. The ‚Äò15-minute city‚Äô, in particular, heralded a new vision for cities where essential services must be easily accessible. Despite its undoubted merit in stimulating discussion on new organization of cities, the 15-minute city cannot be applicable everywhere, and its very definition raises a few concerns. Here we tackle the feasibility and practicability of the 15-minute city model in many cities worldwide. We provide a worldwide quantification of how close cities are to the ideal of the 15-minute city. To this end, we measure the accessibility times to resources and services, and we reveal strong heterogeneity of accessibility within and across cities, with a pivotal role played by local population densities. We provide an online platform (https://whatif.sonycsl.it/15mincity/) to access and visualize accessibility scores for virtually all cities worldwide. The heterogeneity of accessibility within cities is one of the sources of inequality. We thus simulate how much a better redistribution of resources and services could heal inequity by keeping the same resources and services or by allowing for virtually infinite resources. We highlight pronounced discrepancies among cities in the minimum number of additional services needed to comply with the 15-minute city concept. We conclude that the proximity-based paradigm must be generalized to work on a wide range of local population densities. Finally, socio-economic and cultural factors should be included to shift from time-based to value-based cities.},

We explore how Ribot and Peluso‚Äôs Theory of Access can be applied to address critical theoretical gaps in SES by examining how its structural and relational access mechanisms relate to diversity, feedbacks and connectivity which are central to the dynamics of SES. Testing this through two different case studies, on land use issues in Mexico and marine fisheries in the United Kingdom, we illustrate how an analysis focused on access deepens our understanding of resilience. We argue that the insights provided by the Theory of Access contribute to an improved theorization of the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù in social-ecological resilience.},

  abstract = {Tropical deforestation and forest degradation are among the top global threats to biodiversity, carbon storage and rural livelihoods, but the social processes underlying these changes remain difficult to observe across large spatial scales and in data-poor contexts such as tropical Africa. We link longitudinal survey data from agricultural households in rural Uganda to high-resolution satellite data on forest cover change, and use this linked dataset to investigate processes at two scales: tree planting and harvesting at the parcel scale, and deforestation and reforestation at the community scale. This multi-scale analysis reveals that tree planting is more common on parcels with secure tenure, by educated heads and in isolated communities. Deforestation is highest in land-rich, agrarian communities with low population density and high baseline forest cover. These results provide explicit evidence that the social drivers of forest change in Uganda vary across scales, indicating a need for additional multi-scale studies.},

However, most of them overlook the possible plateau association, in which car ownership shows little change as a built environment variable increases within a certain range . Applying gradient boosting decision trees to data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study reveals the complex nonlinear relationships between built environment attributes and car ownership. The results show that although population density and intersection density are strongly and negatively related to car ownership, car ownership exhibits little variation within the middle ranges of these two variables. These plateau associations suggest that reducing car ownership through population and intersection densification is challenging in planning practice. In contrast, directing population growth towards central cities and inner-inning suburbs and densifying transit stops are more promising interventions.},

  abstract = {At the end of World War II, several Latin American countries seemed to be ready for industrialization and self-sustaining economic growth. Instead, they found that they had exchanged old forms of political and economic dependence for a new kind of dependency on the international capitalism of multinational corporations. In the much-acclaimed original Spanish edition ({$<$}em{$>$}Dependencia y Desarrollo en Am√©rica Latina{$<$}/em{$>$}) and now in the expanded and revised English version, Cardoso and Faletto offer a sophisticated analysis of the economic development of Latin America. The economic dependency of Latin America stems not merely from the domination of the world market over internal national and "enclave" economies, but also from the much more complex interact ion of economic drives, political structures, social movements, and historically conditioned alliances. While heeding the unique histories of individual nations, the authors discern four general stages in Latin America's economic development: the early outward expansion of newly independent nations, the political emergence of the middle sector, the formation of internal markets in response to population growth, and the new dependence on international markets. In a postscript for this edition, Cardoso and Faletto examine the political, social and economic changes of the past ten years in light of their original hypotheses.},

This chapter finds that Pacific states have engaged in the negotiations by establishing a core trans-regional coalition (AOSIS), balancing multiple issue-specific coalitions (LDCs, CfRN, CVF, Cartagena, and HAC), and finally evolving to establishing a region-specific coalition (Pacific SIDS). After 30 years of consistent leadership, manoeuvring, multi-actor partnerships, trust in coalitions, and an evolving regime, Pacific states have been, and will continue to be, pivotal players in global climate change negotiations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that regeneration following large-scale disturbance in Kibale National Park, Uganda, is slow or possibly arrested. Here, data is provided on the growth and mortality of seedlings in the forest understory, treefall gaps, and in large gaps that suggest that this pattern of arrested succession can be attributed partially to the fact that this East African community lacks aggressive colonizing tree species. Growth and mortality rates were contrasted for seedlings of six tree species planted in the understory, small gaps, and large gaps for 36 months. Data suggest that species are adapted to gaps of particular sizes. For example, Uvariopsis congensis grew faster in the understory than in small gaps, whereas Warburgia ugandensis had the lowest mortality rate and highest growth rate in large gaps. Seedlings (n=170) of 15 species were transplanted to assess the response of the tree community to large gap conditions. The limited survival of seedlings in large gaps relative to the understory suggests that only a small proportion of the tree community in this forest regenerates best in gaps larger than those created by the collapse of a single tree. These findings differ from a number of studies conducted in other geographical regions, and suggests that tree communities differ with respect to the proportion of tree species adapted to gaps of particular sizes. This may relate to variation among regions in their history of disturbance and thus frequency of gap formation, size of gaps, and the duration of periods of release. Such variation could imply the existence of a corresponding pattern among tropical forests of differential vulnerability to human disturbance, which tends to create many large gaps.},

Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different--and far more satisfying--than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.

However, in the recent literature on conflict and, even more so, in the practice of international and nongovernmental organizations, comparatively little systematic attention has been given to the precise role of economically motivated actions and processes in generating and sustaining contemporary civil conflicts.

Quick to reproduce, highly adaptive, and destroyers of agricultural fields, feral pigs have emerged over the past decade as one of the principal challenges facing agriculture and land management systems in Texas. Yet, more than simply a pest, feral pigs have and continue to be active agents in forging new landscapes, ecologies, and settler-colonial relations. We trace the history of the present pig ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù by exploring three paradigms for thinking pigs and the politics of ferality on the Texas frontier. These paradigms frame pigs as: ‚Äúsettler beasts‚Äù (companion species to settler expansion); ‚Äúmelting-pot beasts‚Äù (feral pigs as representing diverse genetic remnants of settler expansion); and ‚Äúinvader beasts‚Äù (feral pigs framed as a threat). Our argument is that these paradigms index diverse material and discursive ways that feral pigs have and continue to assemble Texas's frontier landscape.},

In this article we challenge four key claims made Paris: imposed and consensual peacebuilding are different experiences; there are no echo of imperialism in modern peacebuilding; there is no alternative to the capitalist free marke and critics of the liberal peace are 'closet liberals'. We argue that Paris ignores the exten to which all peacebuilding strategies have had a core of common prescriptions: neolibera policies of open markets, privatisation and fiscal restraint, and governance policies focus on enhancing instruments of state coercion and 'capacity building' - policies that have proved remarkably resilient even while the democracy and human rights components of th liberal peace have been substantially downgraded. There is little space to (formally) dissen from these policy prescriptions - whether international peacebuilders were originally invite in or not. Furthermore, the deterministic assumption by Paris that 'there is no alternati is unjustifiable. Rather than trying to imagine competing meta-alternatives to liberalism is more constructive to acknowledge and investigate the variety of political economies i post-conflict societies rather than measuring them against a liberal norm.},

Yet, they have recently played a crucial role in negotiating the Paris Agreement and emissions reductions at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The success at Paris is well documented. Here we explain how they also acted as successful policy entrepreneurs at the IMO. Specifically, we find that RMI‚Äôs success can be explained by three factors: vision of the entrepreneur; development of capacity within RMI and the region, and commitment of key actors to create and seize opportunities in available forums, to realise that vision; and strategies to mobilise broader international support. These findings have implications for the literatures on policy entrepreneurship in climate governance and studies that highlight the capacity of small states to influence international affairs.},

Rebel Economies: Warlords, Insurgents, Humanitarians explores historical, anthropological and political dimensions of war economies by non-state actors across different periods and regions, while presenting their multiple manifestations as a unified, congruent phenomenon. Through a variety of conceptual and disciplinary approaches, the authors investigate, in the past and present and across three continents, the nexuses between economy, war, social transformation and state-building, revealing in the process differences and similarities that would otherwise remain hidden. Through this broad-gauge approach, the book aims, first, to rethink much of the debate around ‚Äúnon-state war economies,‚Äù and, secondly, to expand the conversation by consciously treating this theme as a conspicuous and distinct aspect of both economy and war. This is not just a different approach but a fundamental departure from the ways in which current discussions over the economy of wars, civil conflicts, and revolutions, have informed research orientations over several decades.},

  abstract = {The growing scale and intensity of climate change poses a substantial challenge to the status quo of society and politics. Adapting to the risks associated with extreme weather events and changing climatic conditions will require the re-imagination of many aspects of politics and society. Therefore, climate change can be framed as a problem of imagination; one in which our relationship to the future is central to understanding how possibilities in the present are perceived. This research analyses public submissions made on New Zealand‚Äôs first draft National Adaptation Plan to understand how future climate adaptation is framed and imagined by different groups. In analysing submissions we identify and describe four thematic ‚Äòadaptive futures‚Äô that each argue for varied amounts of socio-political change from the status quo: data driven resilience; growth and opportunity; nature-society change; and flaxroots transformation. Underpinning these adaptive futures are emerging advocacy coalitions that seek to shape what is seen as possible, imaginatively, politically and materially. Our analysis also highlights how risks and opportunities are perceived by whom, and insights into attempts to delineate the boundaries of adaptive imagination and political possibility.

To explore the multiple logics, actors and interests driving the conception, preparation and implementation of these plans, we approach urban master planning as a transcalar process, through which diverse investment, planning and governance arrangements are produced and mobilized in ways that transcend the city scale. We illuminate these dynamics by building on an analysis of the history of Japanese development cooperation and drawing on case studies of JICA master planning in Malawi, Ghana and Tanzania.},

  abstract = {Irish republican feminists across twentieth-century Ireland occupied an ambivalent position in the Global North. The Irish were complicit in imperialism in the non-West or Global South. However, they also operated against an evolving backdrop of colonialism, violence and resistance, spanning the all-Ireland anti-colonial campaign, partition, and postcolonial civil war, as well as the late twentieth-century civil rights movement and ensuing ‚ÄòTroubles‚Äô (1969‚Äì1998) north of the disputed border. Irish women were, therefore, subject to various iterations of violent patriarchy informed by British imperialism, anti-colonialism, settler-colonialism or postcoloniality. Using the texts of a small number of prominent Irish republican feminists, including Helena Molony (1883‚Äì1967) and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington (1877‚Äì1946), as well as Bernadette Devlin (1947‚Äì) and Roisin Boyd (?‚Äì) later in the century, this article examines political women‚Äôs attempts to understand their positionality and, through this, formulate their identity. To do so, I am indebted to Global South feminist and ‚Äòfeminist of colour‚Äô epistemologies, beginning with Chandra Mohanty‚Äôs understanding of relevant terminology as denoting ‚Äòpolitical and analytic sites and methodologies‚Äô rather than geographical or spatial constructs. I hope to use this theorising in a way that does not perpetrate a recolonising of ‚Äòwomen of colour‚Äô knowledge.},

  abstract = {Spatial imbalances in metro ridership significantly reduce the overall efficiency of metro system. Understanding the factors that contribute to metro ridership is essential for developing targeted strategies to improve ridership equity and overall system performance. This study introduces novel spatial dependency indices based on spatial weight matrices and land-use function complementarity to explore how access and inter-station spatial dependency affect metro ridership, focusing on station-level boardings and alightings, as well as station-to-station flows. Using the data from the Xi'an Metro, the findings indicate that access to employment and residence from metro stations considerably enhances station-level boardings and alightings. Walking access emerges as a critical factor, especially in the context of station-to-station travel. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a complementarity feature within the metro system, where increases in boardings (alightings) at one station leads to a higher demand at others. Stations that serve areas with complementary land-use functions tend to attract more travel between them. These findings emphasize the critical role of access and spatial dependency in enhancing transit planning and system efficiency.},

Nevertheless, like all other energy sectors in the Russian Federation, it faces a number of problems, including low domestic prices, a poor regulatory framework, little competition, underinvestment and environmental failure. There is little know‚Äêledge of the real needs and problems of the sector, including high production costs, weak transport infrastructure, low investment and obsolete technical equipment, but instead there is permanent political pressure to increase the tax burden. In this context the analysis presented in the article contributes to ongoing discussions and presents a number of numerical estimations relating to the current situation of the oil sector in Russia, including overall sector revenue, cost estimates, total tax burden, present level of investment etc., and simulations of the situation in the sector under different future oil price scenarios.},

Current mechanisms of money justice are civil justice awards or out-of-court settlements for personal or cultural injury; redress programs or schemes for mass atrocities, political repression, historical injustice, and institutional abuse; and payments for war-related wrongs, terrorism, violent common crime, and contaminated blood products, among many others. In this article, we elucidate the concept of money justice, sketch the relationship of revenge and recompense in human history, distil relevant research, and put forward the money justice matrix, which provides a systematic way to analyse money payments (or lack of payments) in varied contexts of victimisation and with different justice mechanisms. Money justice is a new concept that analyses diverse wrongs studied in criminology, socio-legal studies, other social sciences, transitional justice, and historical injustice. Its contribution to new knowledge is two-fold. First, it will map and compare payments to survivors for diverse wrongs, investigate why payments differ, and assess inequalities in payments. Second, it will critically examine the money justice paradox. If, as victims say, money cannot recompense a wrong, why is money sought by victims and offered as justice? More generally, what does money achieve (or not achieve) as justice and for victims?},

While young refugees demonstrated great capacity to act and find new pathways through difficult situations, these tended to be temporary.

While protests, slogans, strategies and demands are expressions of a specific context-bound protest culture, they have the potential to resonate globally. In this way, specific protests become a model for other social movements, although not without tension or reconfigurations of activism. In this article, we explore the transnational flow of the ideas around ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô, developed initially by the South African student movement. From 2015, several university-based protests in South Africa coalesced under the slogan ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô, most prominently \#RhodesMustFall and \#FeesMustFall. This ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô idea resonated transnationally in multiple contexts. However, protests using ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô also drew from other resources and held different meanings across the different contexts, creating a complex transnational flow of partially connected protests across Africa, Europe, and the US. Nevertheless, the ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô protests were similar in expressing a need for a radical change to rupture and overcome structures of oppression, especially those shaped by colonialism. This article analyses the Global South genesis and meaning of the ‚ÄòMust Fall‚Äô protests and how they travelled, resonating differently in both Southern and Northern contexts.},

  abstract = {n this article, I use qualitative data from Northern Norway to explore how Sami fragmentation is articulated and performed in people‚Äôs everyday life. The people who have participated in the project tell stories about how they experience being Sami in a Northern Norwegian context. Some have had a strong sense of Sami identity their whole life, while others have experienced great changes regarding their articulations of Saminess. Rather than understanding the inbetween space between Norwegian and Sami culture as something that creates scattered identities, I analyze the performative Saminess in people‚Äôs everyday life. I use a postcolonial and Indigenous perspective to discuss how decolonization, as a way of dealing with cultural fragmentation, is something that people perform in their everyday life. Indigenous peoples experience a fragmentation that is a direct result of colonization. This fragmentation thus is less a choice than a constant reminder of the loss of land, languages, traditional knowledge, and communities. The Indigenous project is thus a project of putting oneself back together again. Through Indigenous and postcolonial theory, I explore how people recreate the in-between space, altering it from something chaotic and unpredictable to a Sami-Norwegian intercultural space where they can perform their own sense of cultural belonging. As a space of decolonization, this thus becomes a creative and dynamic space where they can awaken the once hidden fragments of Sami culture in a way that make sense in their own everyday life. 1 Astri Dankertsen is a postdoctoral fellow at Nord University, Norway. She is currently working on a project on Sami youth organization in urban areas, and a project on professional understandings of culture and gender in South Sami psychiatric health care. In her PhD thesis, she analyzed Sami articulations, loss and reconciliation, through the concept of Sami melancholia and theories of affect and performativity.},

In several growing metropolitan areas, local authorities have to decide whether to rely on existing radial lines connecting suburban areas to the city-center, or to develop new circular lines directly connecting suburban areas. An efficient transit system aims at reducing external costs of transport (congestion and pollution) by attracting private car users. We study the effect of two types of policies on the modal split. First, we compare the effect of three administration regimes (public, semi-public and private) on the external costs of transport. Second, we consider the opening of a new transit line directly linking the suburbs. We find that it reduces aggregate user cost but is not Pareto-improving unless crowding is high on existing transit lines. Our analysis is complemented by a numerical illustration based on an open source Fortran program. This tool needs a relatively small set of data and can be used by policy makers wishing to investigate the pricing reforms or the possibility of opening a new transit line for a specific case study.},

Estimated TOSSD flows to Nigeria in 2016 amounted to approximately USD 3 billion of official development finance and USD 1.9 billion of private finance mobilised through official development interventions. These first orders of magnitude have been estimated using OECD DAC Statistics. However, these figures are likely to be largely underestimated due to information gaps, notably on the People‚Äôs Republic of China (hereafter China) and emerging providers‚Äô official support to Nigeria. The results of the pilot also indicate that the current organisational set up of Nigeria, both from an institutional and an IT system perspective, makes it challenging for the Government to access, collate, collect analyse and use data on external financing to the country using national data. The TOSSD pilot in Nigeria confirmed the usefulness of country pilots for testing the TOSSD methodology and for ensuring feedback by partner countries on TOSSD as a measurement framework. The findings also helped to ascertain that the International TOSSD Task Force developing the framework is in the right direction with regard to the main parameters of the measure. Findings contained in the present Working Paper will support the discussions to refine the emerging TOSSD Reporting Instructions in 2018 and 2019.},

Increasingly, government agencies and world leaders are recognizing the critical importance of including Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in the development of sustainable responses. To date, however, opportunities for meaningful Indigenous engagement in the creation and development of climate solutions remain few and far between. Where such opportunities do exist, they are most often designed with the intention of trying to `incorporate' limited elements of Indigenous thinking into an established non-Indigenous framework. This process of `Indigenizing' mainstream initiatives achieves little if anything in the way of deconstructing the colonial world view that has caused the climate crisis in the first place. Actively decolonizing Canada's and the world's responses to climate change is absolutely necessary if global society is to achieve the `transformation' of our economies and societies deemed essential for our survival by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), among others. No longer can we afford to simply `tweak the system' by slotting into mainstream processes those elements of Indigenous world view that seem to `fit' most comfortably. If we continue to value the colonial system of neoliberalism and runaway capitalism over those proven sustainable paradigms wherein respect for all life is paramount, then no lasting solutions are possible. Instead, we need to `flip the script', and start providing spaces wherein Indigenous thinking and world view provide the fundamental framework, and non-Indigenous ideas that align sufficiently with Indigenous principles may be incorporated as appropriate. This article recounts a panel discussion, hosted by Indigenous Climate Action, in which four influential Indigenous climate researchers, organizers and policy experts share their reflections on how climate research and policy can be actively decolonized. The panelists draw on their experiences to engage and encourage the audience, listeners, and readers to explore ways to decolonize their own perspectives and to support climate solutions inclusive of all People.},

The researchers offer a discussion of obstacles, resolutions and key recommendations for future studies exploring the methods of web scraping. This article provides common barriers in the process, such as expertise and technology resources, as well as key considerations, such as strategies for conducting methods in a virtual work environment and navigating both hardware and software demands. After many obstacles, the team ultimately accomplished the method aim, finding that web scraping is a highly effective and efficient research method that demands in-depth planning, preparedness for obstacles, and resource considerations.},

  abstract = {Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.},

  abstract = {Desertification is a change in soil properties, vegetation or climate, which results in a persistent loss of ecosystem services that are fundamental to sustaining life. Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a ‚Äúdesertified‚Äù (or ‚Äúdegraded‚Äù) state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e.g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e.g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of ‚Äúenvironmental refugees‚Äù displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world.},

  abstract = {Environmental peacebuilding represents a paradigm shift from a nexus of environmental scarcity to one of environmental peace. It rests on the assumption that the biophysical environment?s inherent characteristics can act as incentives for cooperation and peace, rather than violence and competition. Based on this, environmental peacebuilding presents cooperation as a win-win solution and escape from the zero-sum logic of conflict. However, there is a lack of coherent environmental peacebuilding framework and evidence corroborating the existence of this environment-peace nexus. Building on a multidisciplinary literature review, this article examines the evolution of environmental peacebuilding into an emerging framework. It unpacks the concept and explains its main building blocks (conditions, mechanisms and outcomes) to develop our understanding of when, how and why environmental cooperation can serve as a peacebuilding tool. It assembles these building blocks into three generic trajectories (technical, restorative and sustainable environmental peacebuilding), each characterised according to their own causality, drivers and prerequisites, and illustrated with concrete examples. Finally, this article draws attention to the remaining theoretical gaps in the environmental peacebuilding literature, and lays the foundations for an environmental peacebuilding research agenda that clarifies if and how environmental cooperation can spill over across borders, sectors and scales towards sustainable peace.},

The combined effects of a highly competitive funding environment and security concerns of governments has produced a context in which NGOs strategically invoke the idea of the illegal wildlife trade as a security threat. For donors and governments, tackling the illegal wildlife trade is a means through which they can address security threats. However, this has material outcomes for marginalized peoples living with wildlife, including militarization, human rights abuses, enhanced surveillance, and law enforcement.},

Marketed as a preeminent solution to mitigating climate change, wind energy is now applying increasing pressure on indigenous groups in the region. The article begins by outlining a definition of colonialism that assists in identifying the temporal continuity of the colonial project to understand its relationship with wind energy development. The next section briefly reviews colonial genocide studies, discussing disciplinary debates between liberal and postliberal genocide scholars, the relevance of self-management within colonial systems, the genocide-ecocide nexus and the ‚Äòintent‚Äô of destructive development projects. This leads into reviewing the claims and findings that emerged from fieldwork in the Istmo, which is divided into the north and south to show the different, yet similar dynamics taking place in the region. Finally, the article concludes that wind energy development as a ‚Äòsolution‚Äô to climate change not only distracts from its dependence on fossil fuels and mining, but renews and continues a slow industrial genocide, assimilating and targeting (indigenous) people who continue to value their land, sea and cultural relationships.},

  abstract = {The civil-military interface in peace support operations is changing due to increasingly overlapping tasks, increased military involvement in humanitarian activities, and increased integration of all involved actors, not least through various current strategic concepts. This article not only describes these trends, but also, more importantly, analyses certain consequences in terms of mission effectiveness. The focus of the analysis is the ideas of ‚Äòmilitarisation of humanitarian aid‚Äô and the reverse ‚Äòhumanitarianisation of the military‚Äô. The main arguments of this contribution are that the assumptions of increased effectiveness stemming from civil-military integration cannot be taken for granted and that there are harmful consequences stemming from blurring the lines between civilian, humanitarian and military actors. There is, in other words, a need to better specify and explain the causal mechanisms that lead to effectiveness in complex peace support operations.},

Institutional uncertainty, large-scale decentralisation reforms and the deterioration of formal legal authority in post New Order Indonesia tempted these processes. This apparent lawlessness became especially evident along the fringes of the Indonesian state where state authority has continuously been waxing and waning and contested. This paper argues that by observing these processes of ‚Äòlawlessness‚Äô and vigilantism from the borderlands provides us with an exceptional window in understanding the ambiguous relationship between law and order in post-New Order Indonesia.},

It argues that marginal borders and adjacent borderlands where state institutions are often weak, and state power continuously waxes and wanes, encourage the growth of non-state forms of authority based on long-standing patron‚Äìclient relationships. These complex interdependencies become especially potent because of traditionally rooted patterns of respect, charismatic leadership and a heightened sense of autonomy among borderland populations. The article contends that an examination of these informal arrangements is imperative for understanding the rationale behind border people's often fluid loyalties and illicit cross-border practices, strained relationships with their nation states and divergent views of legality and illegality. The article contributes to recent anthropological studies of borders and believes that these studies could gain important insight by re-examining the concept of patronage as an analytical tool in uncovering circuits of licit and illicit exchange in borderlands.},

  abstract = {Borderland regions in Southeast Asia have increasingly been reimagined as resource-rich, unexploited ‚Äòwastelands‚Äô targeted for large-scale development schemes for economic integration and control. Common and overlapping features of these regions are processes of resource extraction, agricultural expansion, population resettlement and securitization, and the confluence of these dynamic processes creates special frontier constellations. Through the case of the Indonesian-Malaysian borderlands, I explore how processes of frontier colonization through agricultural expansion have been a recurrent product of Indonesian development and security policies since the early 1960s. I argue that frontier development accelerates and intensifies when national discourses of security and sovereignty and state-led agrarian expansion intersect along national borders. The study generates new insights into how contemporary state-capitalist processes of agricultural expansion in the borderlands of Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia are justified through discourses of national sovereignty and notions of ‚Äòuntamed‚Äô and ‚Äòwild‚Äô resource frontiers. I highlight the multiple meanings and notions associated with regions where resource frontiers and national borders interlock. The study offers an explanation of how frontiers as discursive constructs and material realities play out along national borders.},

More specifically, this introduction has three objectives. The first is to locate the focus of this book - community-based adaptation - in the broader context of ongoing development challenges and the international climate change negotiations. This is the purpose of the following two sections. The second objective is to develop a framework for understanding adaptation. This is the task of the middle five sections, in which attention is drawn to the importance of uncertainty in climate predictions, the role of vulnerability in adaptation, and the components of adaptive capacity and resilience. The importance of an appreciation of the role played by culture in adaptation interventions is also highlighted. The concepts presented in these sections are illustrated with examples from the case study chapters that follow and are drawn together to offer a coherent approach to understanding adaptation. Third and finally, the last section provides an overview of the chapters that make up the remainder of the book.},

  abstract = {Adaptation research and practice too often overlooks the wider social context within which climate change is experienced. Mainstream approaches frame adaptation problems in terms of the consequences that flow from biophysical impacts and as a result, we argue, ask the wrong questions. A complementary approach gaining ground in the field, foregrounding the social, economic and political context, reveals differentiation in adaptation need, and how climate impacts interconnect with wider processes of change. In this paper, we illustrate how this kind of approach frames a different set of questions about adaptation using the case of Nepal. Drawing on fieldwork and a review of literature, we contrast the questions that emerge from adaptation research and practice that take climate risk as a starting point with the questions that emerge from examination of contemporary rural livelihoods. We find that while adaptation efforts are often centred around securing agricultural production and are predicated on climate risk management, rural livelihoods are caught in a wider process of transformation. The numbers of people involved in farming are declining, and households are experiencing the effects of rising education, abandonment of rural land, increasing wages, burgeoning mechanisation, and high levels of migration into the global labour market. We find the epistemological framing of adaptation too narrow to account for these changes, as it understands the experiences of rural communities through the lens of climate risk. We propose that rather than seeking to integrate local understandings into a fixed, impacts-orientated epistemology, it is necessary to premise adaptation on an epistemology capable of exploring how change occurs. Asking the right questions thus means opening up adaptation by asking: ‚Äòwhat are the most significant changes taking place in people's lives?‚Äô, along with the more standard: ‚Äòwhat are the impacts of climate change?‚Äô Viewing adaptation as occurring between and within these two perspectives has the potential to reveal new vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation practice to act upon.},

  abstract = {This paper critically reviews the outcomes of internationally-funded interventions aimed at climate change adaptation and vulnerability reduction. It highlights how some interventions inadvertently reinforce, redistribute or create new sources of vulnerability. Four mechanisms drive these maladaptive outcomes: (i) shallow understanding of the vulnerability context; (ii) inequitable stakeholder participation in both design and implementation; (iii) a retrofitting of adaptation into existing development agendas; and (iv) a lack of critical engagement with how ‚Äòadaptation success‚Äô is defined. Emerging literature shows potential avenues for overcoming the current failure of adaptation interventions to reduce vulnerability: first, shifting the terms of engagement between adaptation practitioners and the local populations participating in adaptation interventions; and second, expanding the understanding of ‚Äòlocal‚Äô vulnerability to encompass global contexts and drivers of vulnerability. An important lesson from past adaptation interventions is that within current adaptation cum development paradigms, inequitable terms of engagement with ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô populations are reproduced and the multi-scalar processes driving vulnerability remain largely ignored. In particular, instead of designing projects to change the practices of marginalised populations, learning processes within organisations and with marginalised populations must be placed at the centre of adaptation objectives. We pose the question of whether scholarship and practice need to take a post-adaptation turn akin to post-development, by seeking a pluralism of ideas about adaptation while critically interrogating how these ideas form part of the politics of adaptation and potentially the processes (re)producing vulnerability. We caution that unless the politics of framing and of scale are explicitly tackled, transformational interventions risk having even more adverse effects on marginalised populations than current adaptation.},

How did the postwar discourse on development actually create the so-called Third World? And what will happen when development ideology collapses? To answer these questions, Arturo Escobar shows how development policies became mechanisms of control that were just as pervasive and effective as their colonial counterparts. The development apparatus generated categories powerful enough to shape the thinking even of its occasional critics while poverty and hunger became widespread. "Development" was not even partially "deconstructed" until the 1980s, when new tools for analyzing the representation of social reality were applied to specific "Third World" cases. Here Escobar deploys these new techniques in a provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general, concluding with a discussion of alternative visions for a postdevelopment era.  Escobar emphasizes the role of economists in development discourse--his case study of Colombia demonstrates that the economization of food resulted in ambitious plans, and more hunger. To depict the production of knowledge and power in other development fields, the author shows how peasants, women, and nature became objects of knowledge and targets of power under the "gaze of experts."  In a substantial new introduction, Escobar reviews debates on globalization and postdevelopment since the book's original publication in 1995 and argues that the concept of postdevelopment needs to be redefined to meet today's significantly new conditions. He then calls for the development of a field of "pluriversal studies," which he illustrates with examples from recent Latin American movements.},

The chapters, which were originally written as essays, point towards diverse ontologies- or modes of being in the world -and ultimately offer tools for thinking about what to do in our current planetary crisis, one driven by predatory global capitalism. Escobar moves us toward a pluriversal worldview, or a world where many worlds fit, and gestures at how we can find evidence of these possibilities in social movements, particularly Afro-Colombian and indigenous movements from Colombia. These indigenous movement leaders in Colombia problematize ontologies in defense of their territories, worlds, and modes of existing thereby destabilizing notions of the real and the possible. Most of the essays were originally written in Spanish between 2014 and 2017, and presented in contexts ranging from academic presentations to activist gatherings. Chapter 1 explores diverse examples of the real and the possible, such as those found in ancestral traditions and in other societies as well as those theorized by academics in attempts to destabilize the real. Chapter 2 proposes ways of thinking from the bottom and with the Earth, inspired by the revolutionary Mexican Zapatistas. In chapter 3 Escobar presents a discourse analysis of a statement by the Nasa people of the Northern Cauca region of Colombia to argue for the adoption of a Mother Earth Liberation concept/movement. Chapters 4 and 5, respectively, explore epistemologies of the South and autonomous social theory productions from Latin America. Chapter 6 considers the idea of "living beyond development" and examines relevant experiences in the resistance to development that provide a glimpse into other worlds while chapter 7 considers a radical sustainability strategy for Colombia given the current planetary crisis. Finally, chapter 8 imagines a different design for the ecologically devasted city of Cali, Colombia, a new design grounded in self-organization and the relationality of life. This book will be of interested to students and scholars in anthropology, social theory, and Latin American studies"--},

After introducing the indigenous notion of ‚Äòterricide‚Äô and discussing Sylvia Wynter‚Äôs argument about the need to challenge the dominant view of the human as liberal, secular, Western and bourgeois, the article outlines the ontological perspective of relationality as a reemerging understanding of the fundament of Life that sharply differs from the dominant dualistic ontology of the modern West. The second part of the article proposes six axes for transition strategies: the re-communalization of social life; the re-localization of social, economic, and cultural activities; the strengthening of local autonomies; the de-patriarchalization and de-racialization of social relations; the re-integration with the Earth; and the construction of meshworks among transformative alternatives.},

The authors contend that the key to constructing livable worlds lies in the cultivation of ways of knowing and acting based on a profound awareness of the fundamental interdependence of everything that exists ‚Äì what they refer to as relationality. This shift in paradigm is necessary for healing our bodies, ecosystems, cities, and the planet at large. The book follows two interwoven threads of argumentation: on the one hand, it explains and exemplifies the modes of operation and the dire consequences of non-relational living; on the other, it elucidates the nature of relationality and explores how it is embodied in transformative practices in multiple spheres of life. The authors provide an instructive account of the philosophical, scientific, social, and political sources of relational theory and action, with the aim of illuminating the transition from living within seemingly ineluctable 'toxic loops' of unrelational living (based on ontological dualism), to living within 'relational weaves' which we might co-create with multiple human and nonhuman others‚Äù--},

The Yugoslavs' brand of market socialism placed reliance on markets to guide both domestic and international production and exchange, with the socialist element coming from the ‚Äúsocial ownership‚Äù and workers' self-management of enterprises. The system seemed successful until the late 1970s. However, in recent years, many of the problems besetting other socialist economies like Poland and Hungary‚Äîlike stagnation, international debt, enterprise inefficiency, and inflation‚Äîhave emerged to bring the whole experiment into question. Reforms paralleling those elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe are now on the agenda. This paper will first describe how the Yugoslav economy has been distinguished from those of its socialist neighbors. The following sections will describe the economic record of Yugoslavia since the 1950s and the lessons to be drawn from the long-standing Yugoslav experiment.},

In turn, commuting is a major driver of energy consumption and of socio-environmental externalities in cities. So far, few quantitative and comparative assessments of paratransit in cities of Africa have been carried out due to data scarcity and the prevalence of informal services. Here we leverage the recent release of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to produce comparative metrics of accessibility, network, and service quality of paratransit in seven major cities in sub-Saharan Africa (Abidjan, Accra, Addis Ababa, Freetown, Harare, Kampala, Nairobi). Our results allow for a first-order assessment and comparison of different crucial paratransit characteristics in these cities, shedding light on transport inequality and urban segregation dynamics. The analysis and metrics produced can support transport systems planners in major cities of low-income countries. Further research should focus on approaches for overcoming the residual data limitations and expand the quantitative understanding of paratransit.},

Contrary to early efforts' transfer of established technologies from the West to developing countries, contemporary technology aspirations increasingly articulate and practice the Global South as a live laboratory for technological experimentation. This approach is especially furthered by a group of private foundations and philanthrocapitalists whose endeavors in developing countries are, like their companies, shaped by logics of the individual, the market, and of societal progress through technological innovation and experimentation. This article draws upon critical intellectual thought about the political and social ramifications of technology to reflect on the renascent role of technology in development cooperation. It traces the discourses and practices of philanthrocapitalist organizations, in particular the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to understand how their experimentalist technology aspirations influence human life and relations in the Global South. This article argues that this newfound focus on technology in development cooperation may challenge the essence of democracy, reduce participation, and have undesirable consequences for populations in the Global South.},

I identify indigenous social systems with respect to globalization (Hall and Fenelon 2008; 2009), using world-system analysis, with strong doses of resistance and revitalization discussions from earlier works, including the United States‚Äô intentional destruction of ‚Äúculture‚Äù and collective organizing by Native Nations (Fenelon 1998). The modern world-system has ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù into a set of global crises that put the entire world into conflict and increasing chaos. Premier among these crises are competitive strong states during the hegemonic decline of the United States, associated with global climate change-partly the result of centuries of unrestrained industrial development. I observe early development of the modern world as European expansion and colonization of the Western Hemisphere, fueled by wealth production and resource extraction from Native Nations. Ultimately this gave rise to state structures in North America that industrialized, building capitalism into powerful economies. Here we see crises of centralized systems and their militaries, operating globally in neoliberalism and based on systemic production of inequality.},

This is contemporary anthropology of the most relevant, responsible and intellectually sophisticated kind." ‚ÄîUlf Hannerz, Stockholm University"A deeply thoughtful book, written with enormous sensitivity. I much admired Ferguson's very original take on African 'modernity.' His engagement with cultural studies is always informed by a deep historical understanding and an appreciation of economic realities. He connects critically but sympathetically with both his informants and with earlier generations of urban anthropologists. The book is often moving--the hardships of life in this 'abject' postmodern setting are too evident, but the amazing creativity of urban 'citemene' culture is wonderfully described. And Ferguson's account of the fraught, conflictual and sometimes violent nature of gender relations is extremely important. Certainly one of the best books on Africa I have read in recent years, this will be required reading for anthropologists and historians." ‚ÄîMegan Vaughan, Oxford University},

  abstract = {In this article, I seek to identify a limitation in the analysis James Scott offers in Seeing Like a State (1998) by asking to what extent his account of the follies of schemes for planned improvement by states provides critical leverage on the present world of neoliberal global capitalism. Scott has claimed that a dynamic of standardization, homogenization, and grid making applies not only to developmentalist states but also equally to the contemporary world of downsized states and unconstrained global corporations. I contest that claim by tracing how recent capital investment in Africa has been territorialized, and some of the new forms of order and disorder that have accompanied that selectively territorialized investment. Because such investment has been overwhelmingly in mineral resource extraction‚Äîparticularly in oil‚Äîa contrast will become visible between the homogenizing, standardizing state optic Scott analyzed and a rather different way of seeing, proper to the contemporary global oil company.},

Yet a rich empirical literature in the region shows that producing agricultural goods is really only one of many, many ways in which land is used, and not necessarily the most important. This paper argues that many of the ways in which land is used (often labelled ‚Äòsocial‚Äô or ‚Äòcultural‚Äô) are in fact best understood as part of processes of distribution that are a vital part of many poor Southern Africans' livelihoods. An exclusive focus on production as the problem, and more productive agriculture as the solution, blinds us both to most of the things that people, in fact, do with land, and to many of the most important issues facing low-income rural people. Giving a more central place to processes of distribution may help us to see just how much is lost if we allow distribution to be treated as an afterthought to production ‚Äì or the land question to be reduced to the agrarian question.},

Yet Karl Marx's own deployment of the figure of the proletariat, which often provides the inspiration and model for such analogic moves, was itself in its own time already a complex historical analogy, invoking the social hierarchies of ancient Rome. Rethinking this doubly analogical intellectual history provides an occasion both for considering the uses and abuses of historical analogy, and for using a reflection on the original (Roman) proletarians as a conceptual lever for prying apart some outdated assumptions about the contemporary politics of certain propertyless urban populations, in southern Africa and beyond.},

Globalization, government policies, capitalism, colonialism, and other rapid social-ecological changes threaten the relationships between Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their environments, thereby challenging the continuity and dynamism of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK). In this article, we contribute to the ‚ÄúWorld Scientists‚Äô Warning to Humanity,‚Äù issued by the Alliance of World Scientists, by exploring opportunities for sustaining ILK systems on behalf of the future stewardship of our planet. Our warning raises the alarm about the pervasive and ubiquitous erosion of knowledge and practice and the social and ecological consequences of this erosion. While ILK systems can be adaptable and resilient, the foundations of these knowledge systems are compromised by ongoing suppression, misrepresentation, appropriation, assimilation, disconnection, and destruction of biocultural heritage. Three case studies illustrate these processes and how protecting ILK is central to biocultural conservation. We conclude with 15 recommendations that call for the recognition and support of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their knowledge systems. Enacting these recommendations will entail a transformative and sustained shift in how ILK systems, their knowledge holders, and their multiple expressions in lands and waters are recognized, affirmed, and valued. We appeal for urgent action to support the efforts of Indigenous Peoples and local communities around the world to maintain their knowledge systems, languages, stewardship rights, ties to lands and waters, and the biocultural integrity of their territories‚Äîon which we all depend.},

Globalized through (neo)colonialism/(neo)imperialism, it has subjugated the rural under the urban and the Global South under the North, becoming globally hegemonic. Through the coloniality of power hegemonic conceptions of progress, growth, development and modernity have been spread, procuring the loyalty of semi-peripheral and peripheral regimes into a civilizational obsession with endless accumulation based on the ‚Äúmastery of nature.‚Äù Most ‚Äúpostcolonial‚Äù elites, especially across ‚Äúemerging economies,‚Äù have not broken with this coloniality.

  abstract = {Two critical accounts of the global ecological crisis of civilization have emerged recently. On the one hand, Marxian, critical political-ecology and world-systems approaches to environmental social science have engendered insightfulperspectives like world-systems ecology. We emphasize this approach‚Äôs account of the planetary ‚Äúrift‚Äù of civilization, especially modern ‚Äì mostly Western ‚Äì capitalist civilization and its historical expansion and globalization (e.g., Foster et al. 2010; Clark and York 2005; Moore 2000; Schneider and McMichael 2010; Wittman 2009). On the other hand, indigenous efforts to revitalize, reconfigure, and recirculate ancestral traditions ‚Äì as part of their longstanding struggles for emancipation from the hegemonic world-system ‚Äì have coalesced into an alternative indigenous paradigm, heretofore termed ‚Äúindigeneity‚Äù: a plexus of worldviews, knowledges, practices and communal lifeways that advances decolonial and non/post-anthropocentric alternatives to the ecological crisis of civilization (e.g., Stewart-Harawira 2012; Grim 2001; Cajete 2000; Wildcat 2009; Waters 2004; Cordova 2007; Waziyatawin and Yellow Bird 2012; CAOI et. al. 2011; Huanacuni-Mamani 2010; Yampara 2001; Medina 2006; Cochoy Alva and Yac Noj 2012; Reyes 2008; Lenkersdorf 2004; Figueroa-Helland 2012; Cormie in this volume). We draw on these two accounts to critique and propose alternatives to theplanetary ecological rift of civilization. We argue that the world-systems ecology critique of the ‚Äúmetabolic rift‚Äù driving the planetary crisis reinforces the need to revitalize indigeneity. While the former warns of the consequences of a political economy that ruptures the Earth‚Äôs metabolism, the latter fosters lifeways that see Earth as Mother and demand we (re)organize human affairs in accordance to and with reverence for Mother Earth‚Äôs living planetary metabolism. We thus contend that revalorizing indigenous knowledges, practices, movements, and modes of communal socio-ecological organization is indispensable for overcoming the crisis. Moreover, the revitalization and creative reconfiguration of indigeneity enables us to prefigure viable alternatives beyond the hegemonic civilization. First, we outline the problems constituting the planetary rift, discussing some ofthe planetary boundaries civilization has crossed or risks crossing. We attribute this crisis to the rupture between, on the one hand, an anthropocentric, linear, growth-oriented modern, predominantly capitalist, industrial civilization, and on the other, the cyclical metabolism of a living planet Earth. Here we draw on Marxian, critical political-ecology and world-systems ecology critiques of the ‚Äúmetabolic/ecological rift.‚Äù We find this concept valuable not just because it helps diagnose the roots of the crisis, but also because conceptualizing human/ non-human nature relations as a metabolism enables us to understand Earth as a living body whose health at least partly depends on human conduct. This helps explain why indigenous perspectives see humanity as embedded in Mother Earth‚Äôs nurturing metabolism, why we are co-constitutive of her metabolism and therefore ethically co-responsible for nurturing her overall health as she has nurtured us. In this context, we propose that if we are to repair the metabolic rift we mustfirst decolonize our relationship to Mother Earth by revitalizing indigenous knowledges and lifeways and heeding their call to live within her metaboliccycles and limits. After introducing the indigenous paradigm, we exemplify it through indigenous knowledges, practices, movements, and alternative modes of communal socio-ecological organization from (a) Abya Yala/Turtle Island (indigenous Americas) and (b) South Asian adivasi peoples. Building on decolonial, post-Eurocentric and post-secular critiques (Conway, this volume; Cormie, this volume) we argue indigeneity can help address the planetary rift by revitalizing cyclical cosmologies. We conclude by inviting world-systems ecology ‚Äì and related perspectives ‚Äì to engage indigenous knowledges, spiritualities, practices, movements, and organizations, as the proactive revitalization and creative reconfiguration of indigeneity offers a blueprint for socio-ecologically just, harmonious, and viable alternatives to the global crisis.},

Playing catch-up with the North and its unsustainable mode of political economy demands the present-day rehearsal, in accelerated, compressed and subimperial modes of the structurally violent practices that have underpinned the North‚Äôs ‚Äúrise‚Äù to planetary dominance. Yet in striving to catch-up and join in the overconsumptive and exploitative lifestyle of economic cores, large ‚Äúemerging economies‚Äù like the brics are in an economic, political and military crash course against the hegemonically-entrenched Northern core powers they aspire to emulate, in what looks like an increasingly volatile scramble to grab whatever dwindling ecological space is left in a rapidly degraded planet.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological‚Äìeconomic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socio-economic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socio-economic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5‚Ä≤√ó5‚Ä≤ latitude/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socio-economic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socio-economic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change.},

Why has social science failed in attempts to emulate natural science and produce normal theory? Bent Flyvbjerg argues that the strength of social sciences lies in its rich, reflexive analysis of values and power, essential to the social and economic development of any society. Richly informed, powerfully argued, and clearly written, this book opens up a new future for the social sciences. Its empowering message will make it required reading for students and academics across the social and behavioral sciences.},

  abstract = {This paper takes stock of megaproject management, an emerging and hugely costly field of study, by first answering the question of how large megaprojects are by measuring them in the units of mega, giga, and tera, and concluding with how we are presently entering a new ‚Äútera era‚Äù of trillion-dollar projects. Second, total global megaproject spending is assessed, at US\$6 to US\$9 trillion annually, or 8\% of the total global gross domestic product (GDP), which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history. Third, four ‚Äúsublimes‚Äù‚Äîpolitical, technological, economic, and aesthetic‚Äîare identified and used to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects. Fourth, the ‚Äúiron law of megaprojects‚Äù is laid out and documented: Over budget, over time, over and over again. Moreover, the ‚Äúbreak‚Äìfix model‚Äù of megaproject management is introduced as an explanation of the iron law. Fifth, Albert O. Hirschman's theory of the ‚ÄúHiding Hand‚Äù is revisited and critiqued as unfounded and corrupting for megaproject thinking in both the academy and policy. Sixth, it is shown how megaprojects are systematically subject to ‚Äúsurvival of the unfittest,‚Äù which explains why the worst projects get built rather than the best. Finally, it is argued that the conventional way of managing megaprojects has reached a ‚Äútension point,‚Äù in which tradition is being challenged and reform is emerging.},

Nothing is more inspiring than a big vision that becomes a triumphant, new reality. Think of how the Empire State Building went from a sketch to the jewel of New York's skyline in twenty-one months, or how Apple's iPod went from a project with a single employee to a product launch in eleven months. These are wonderful stories. But most of the time big visions turn into nightmares. Remember Boston's "Big Dig"? Almost every sizeable city in the world has such a fiasco in its backyard. In fact, no less than 92\% of megaprojects come in over budget or over schedule, or both. The cost of California's high-speed rail project soared from \$33 billion to \$100 billon-and won't even go where promised. More modest endeavors, whether launching a small business, organizing a conference, or just finishing a work project on time, also commonly fail. Why? Understanding what distinguishes the triumphs from the failures has been the life's work of Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg, dubbed "the world's leading megaproject expert." In How Big Things Get Done, he identifies the errors in judgment and decision-making that lead projects, both big and small, to fail, and the research-based principles that will make you succeed with yours"--},

  abstract = {The milpa system is the basis of traditional agriculture in Mesoamerica. It is based on a polyculture of maize (Zea mays L.), bean (Phaseolus spp.) and squash (Cucurbita spp.) and is associated with a great diversity of crops and wild species. The milpa has great cultural and historical importance but can also be highly productive and provide sufficient and healthy diets for smallholder farmers. The milpa system is practiced less and less however, mainly due to socioeconomic changes, but also due to a lack of agronomic knowledge adapted to current conditions. To provide a starting point for new agronomic research, we reviewed the scientific literature to identify the current knowledge on milpa agronomy and determine research priorities to further improve the system. Given the wide diversity of conditions under which milpa is practiced, agronomic research is lacking, but indicates that improvements to the milpa can be made in all aspects of the milpa. 176 research articles on the milpa system were found in databases, of which 61 treated agronomic research. The main agronomic topics described in literature are crop variety, soil fertility management, weed management and productivity. Most research has focused only on maize and studies reporting on the associated crops are scarce. More research on all aspects of the milpa is needed to understand and improve the agronomy of the system under the changing conditions of modern agriculture. Reducing the workload associated with the milpa, as well as soil fertility and weed management can be identified as research priorities.},

The sheer complexity of African cities contests conventional understandings of the urban as well as standard development policies. Lingering between chaos and creativity, Western images of African cities seem unable to serve as a basis for development policies. The diversity of African cities is hard to conceptualise‚Äîbut at the same time, unbiased views of the urban are the first step to addressing the urban development conundrum. International development cooperation should not only make African cities a focus of its engagement‚Äîit should also be cautious not to build its interventions on concepts inherited from Western history, such as the formal/informal dichotomy. We argue that African cities are more appropriately regarded as urban grey zones that only take shape and become colourful through the actors‚Äô agency and practice. The chapters of this special issue offer a fresh look at African cities, and the many opportunities as well as limitations that emerge for African urbanites‚Äîstate officials, planners, entrepreneurs, development agencies and ordinary people‚Äîfrom their own point of view: they ask where, for whom and why such limitations and opportunities emerge, how they change over time and how African urban dwellers actively enliven and shape their cities.},

In this comprehensive guide, Farmer Jesse Frost shares all he has learned through experience and experimentation with no-till practices on his home farm in Kentucky and from interviews and visits with highly successful market gardeners in his role as host of The No-Till Market Garden Podcast. The Living Soil Handbook is centered around the three basic principles of no-till market gardening: 1) disturb the soil as little as possible, 2) keep it covered as much as possible, and 3) keep it planted as much as possible. Farmer Jesse then guides readers in applying those principles to their own garden environment, with their own materials, to meet their own goals. Beginning with an exploration of the importance of photosynthesis to living soil, Jesse provides in-depth information on turning over beds, using compost and mulch, path management, incorporating biology, maintaining fertility, cover cropping, diversifying plantings through intercropping, and production methods for seven major crops. Throughout, the book emphasizes practical information on all the best tools and practices for growers who want to build their livelihood around maximizing the health of their soil. Farmer Jesse reminds growers that "as possible" is the mantra for protecting the living soil: disturb the soil as little as you possibly can in your context. He does not believe that growers should anguish over what does and does not qualify as "no-till." If you are using a tool to promote soil life and biology, that's the goal. Jesse's goal with The Living Soil Handbook is to provide a comprehensive set of options, materials, and field-tested practices to inspire growers to design a soil-nurturing no-till system in their unique garden or farm ecosystem"--},

While the Ugandan groups have been disarmed by their government, the Kenyan Turkana, armed with AK-47s, are allowed into Ugandan territory for pasture during drought, and some Turkana take violent advantage of this power imbalance as they leave. Paradoxically, intervention by Ugandan state institutions that, in the name of peaceful coexistence, welcome the Turkana in Uganda has led to the escalation of conflict, while tribal ‚Äúhalf-trust‚Äù has kept it relatively limited.},

In connection with the latter, I want to present some preliminary thoughts on how restorative justice could be incorporated into future criminal justice systems as de jure punishment. Furthermore, I will suggest that by insisting that restorative justice is radically different from punishment, restorative justice advocates may - contrary to their intentions ‚àí play into the hands of those who want to preserve the status quo rather than developing future criminal justice systems in the direction of restorative justice.},

Symbolic violence built into a culture does not kill or maim like direct violence or the violence built into the structure. However, it is used to legitimize either or both, as for instance in the theory of a Herrenvolk, or a superior race. The relations between direct, structural and cultural violence are explored, using a violence triangle and a violence strata image, with various types of casual flows. Examples of cultural violence are indicated, using a division of culture into religion and ideology, art and language, and empirical and formal science. The theory of cultural violence is then related to two basic points in Gandhism, the doctrines of unity of life and of unity of means and ends. Finally, the inclusion of culture as a major focus of peace research is seen not only as deepening the quest for peace, but also as a possible contribution to the as yet non-existent general discipline of `culturology'.},

It is indeed widely used in technical writings, general public media and environmental protection projects, regardless of the fact that the majority of literature in environmental science does not support its underlying rationales. It depicts rural populations as victims and culprits (or villains) partially responsible for the desertification, which in turn justifies external intervention in the Sahelian countries. The desertification narrative has an impact on research and development funding by overemphasizing the role of international development aid to combat desertification, thus favoring research on the subject of Sahelian desertification. Furthermore, we argue that the Sahelian desertification narrative contributes to the political control of rural populations, the latter being stigmatized because of their often-considered excessive use of environmental resources.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the International Criminal Court (ICC) described its legal practices as offering a balance between retributive and restorative justice. It was held that restorative justice was progressed through its framework of victim participation in legal proceedings. However, there is little research into how, or whether, the Court metes out restorative justice. This article first considers the key pillars of restorative justice as ‚Äòencounter‚Äô, ‚Äòamends‚Äô and ‚Äòreintegration‚Äô, and the form of victim participation within these practices. It then examines how the ICC aligns to the direct participation of victims prioritised by restorative justice, and shows that victims do not hold such participatory possibilities. Instead, legal professionals take on direct participation in dialogue and decision-making processes. Using Bourdieu‚Äôs framing of the juridical field, the article identifies key reasons for the absence of direct victim participation and argues that the ICC primarily functions as a retributive approach to the resolution of conflict.},

  abstract = {The ongoing economic crisis has shifted much of the policy debate to problems of financial sector regulation, productive capacity collapse, among others. However, this leaves unattended the real situation with labour migration, which directly impacts social and economic inner components of being of millions of individual families across the world. The somewhat ad hoc nature of the process poses several policy issues for the home and host economies alike. Immediate concerns relate to streamlining migrants and remittances flows. This involves sensitive aspects of inequality in migrant workers‚Äô labour efforts vis-√†-vis domestic workers; migrants‚Äô social and legal status; and less obvious, but still profound, unproductive misallocation of labour resources. Derived from this premise and recognizing the need for an institutional approach, this paper offers alternative policy solutions to temporary labour migration regulation. This research‚Äôs original propositions include a Diaspora Regulatory Mechanism and a Migration Development Bank, both operating within a state-managed temporary labour migration regime. Fiscal action, including multilateral agreements, is crucial. The functionality of these mechanisms will directly impact infrastructure, human capital and entrepreneurial projects development in both home and host economies. Discussion is inspired by the analysis of actual circumstances in the economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States, where migration is a social, economic, and increasingly political issue. In the interlinked world, diasporas become dominant actors across all society strata. The development plateau of the post-socialist states offers a rich economic and social soil to conduct responsible policy with future outlook. Moreover, conditions of ongoing economic crisis offer a unique opportunity for daring research to propose and for a motivated decisionmaker to implement original, proactive, and beneficial policy solutions aimed at streamlining the (temporary) labour migration process. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on topics of diaspora, labour migration, and remittance flows.},

This article constructs a compact analytical synthesis of the duo's potential across macroeconomic, industrial, external exposure risk, institutional, and the Diaspora (dispersion) effects within the five forces model of the social and economic transformation. Post-Great Recession dynamic analysis, sketching sectoral and business trends, tackles issues of market entry and foreign investor strategy. Armenia's impressive pre-crisis pattern has yet to be recovered, while Georgia's post-crisis record has been more consistent with earlier years. Armenia's entrepreneurial and innovative capacity, vital to new business accommodation, ranks above Georgia's, where traditional sectors are dominant. All in all there is a need for an individual, not ‚Äúbulk‚Äù, analysis of the post-socialist periphery. Foreign firms‚Äô managers are suited to gain if acquire local context and local (or Diaspora-) based partner (public or private) prior to regional or standalone entry. Despite multiple headwinds, both economies retain strong international business potential and hope for an economic and social resurrection.},

  abstract = {This article argues that transitional justice (TJ) has recently been standardised: There is now a two-tiered global standard of TJ which structures policy responses and academic thinking. TJ comprises criminal justice, truth-telling, reparation and institutional reform ‚Äì four core elements in a ‚Äòcomprehensive‚Äô approach. The standard involves specifications for design, procedure and performance and draws on a selection of seemingly unambiguous international legal norms. Paradoxically, it claims to eschew a one-size-fits-all formula, while promoting uniformity in diverse contexts. It is moreover unclear whether its implementation generates beneficial effects in society. Building on existing research on international standardisation as an international political and sociological phenomenon, the article analyses the recently developed TJ standard and presents the first account of the process of TJ standardisation. It demonstrates how processes of ‚Äògenerification‚Äô and ‚Äòlocalisation‚Äô make practices transferable and establish the means to facilitate their replication in and across different contexts and settings. These processes are illustrated drawing on existing scholarship from around the world that highlights the acceptance and contestation of and resistance to the standard. After analysing these processes, the article discusses the implications of TJ standardisation for societies, scholarship and global governance.},

The essays collected in this special section are both responses to our invitation and provocations in their own right. From our point of view, they each take Critical Future Studies forward and collectively augur well for the further development of this field. This introductory essay contains three sections. First, we briefly situate Critical Future Studies within an intellectual and historical context. In the following section we discuss some relevant scholarship published very recently in cognate fields (specifically Anticipation Studies and Sociology) and which are pertinent to Critical Future Studies as a developing field of study. In the final section, we introduce the articles contained in this this special section: six diverse contributions on topics including green capitalism, artificial intelligence and automation, science fiction, post-scarcity societies and the future of work, and socialist futures.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the interdisciplinary field of Critical Future Studies (CFS). CFS investigates the scope and constraints within public culture for imagining and debating different potential futures. It interrogates imagined futures founded ‚Äì often surreptitiously ‚Äì upon values and assumptions from the past and present, as well as those representing a departure from current social trajectories. CFS draws on perspectives from various disciplines including sociology, political studies, intellectual history, cultural history, media and cultural studies, utopian studies, science and technology studies, and philosophy. CFS also engages with discourses and ideas from the natural sciences (including popular science), computing and economics. And, given our concern with public culture, CFS aims to contribute constructively to vigorous and imaginative public debate about the future ‚Äì a futural public sphere ‚Äì and to challenge a prevalent contemporary cynicism about our capacity to imagine alternative futures while trapped in a parlous present. To that extent, we propose CFS as a programme of engaged and open-ended social critique, not as a solely academic endeavour. Our paper begins by describing the relationship between CFS and mainstream Future Studies. Subsequently, we discuss the contemporary context for Critical Future Studies. Here we make the case that CFS is a timely and even urgent project at our current historical juncture, arguing also for the significance of both utopian and dystopian imaginings. We then go on to discuss methodologies within CFS scholarship. Finally, we conclude by reflecting on the values underpinning CFS. Overall, this paper not only describes CFS as a field of research but also serves as an invitation to cultural scholars to consider how their own work might intersect with and contribute to CFS.},

Seven thousand bedouin from six tribes live in or around the protectorate. Recent development pressure, catalysed by tourism, has resulted in the natural resource base of this fragile region being overexploited. An integrated management plan is under development to conserve the area's natural and cultural heritage, and ensure community participation while expanding opportunities for sustainable tourism. Local community guards now enforce a conservation ethic in one of Egypt's most spectacular and fragile regions.},

  abstract = {Environmental problems facing humanity in the 21st century require a reexamination of the beliefs and values that produced them in the first place. In this paper the researcher discusses some of the key environmental challenges facing the southern African region. The researcher point out that, if responses to local environmental problems and the global ecological crisis are to be meaningful (make possible a more sustainable future), then it will require a collective effort on the part of society and at the same time connect to individual‚Äôs values or the values of particular groups. The Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess argued that there can be agreement on environmental principles across cultures, regions and nations and that these principles can be supported by a range of ecophilosophies that are aligned to agreed principles. Naess referred to philosophies that support deep ecology principles as ecophilosophies or ecosophies. Informed by Naess‚Äôs views, in this paper the researcher argues that ubuntu/botho is an ecosophy that is aligned with the principles of the deep ecology movement (DEM). Moreover, that ubuntu can serve as the ecophilosophy/ecosophy that informs policies and practices responsive to the pressing environmental problems facing the southern African region.},

It explores this diversity using the framework of ‚Äòembedded justice‚Äô and ‚Äòdistanced justice‚Äô, and the case studies of South Africa, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The argument draws on Fletcher and Weinstein (2002) to argue that justice needs to be embedded within and to engage the communities, cultures and contexts of conflict. A recent article by Sieff and Vinjamuri (2002) is used to advocate decentralisation. Transitional justice debates have generally overlooked justice, and human rights, as manifest in political, economic and social processes whilst privileging the law, and dismissing the potential of locally generated and embedded justice. The article argues that achieving the correct balance requires a shedding of na√Øve faith in, and the transformation of, both local and international justice, and the contexts within which they operate, whilst seeking to build on their complementary capacities and legitimacies.},

  abstract = {Mountain regions provide diverse goods and services to human society. At the same time, mountain ecosystems are sensitive to rapid global development. Over the past 2 decades the number of papers mentioning ‚Äúecosystem services‚Äù (ESS) has risen exponentially. While the concept holds great potential to improve the societal relevance of conservation efforts, it is at risk of dying of misuse and reduction to a buzzword. The definitions of the term often compete and the utility of the concept is under debate. The present article reviews the literature on mountain ESS to investigate whether the term was understood correctly by the community, and addresses the question whether ESS is a suitable concept to protect mountain regions. We link land use and other physical properties of terrestrial ecosystems with their capacity to provide ESS with a view to mapping the global supply of ESS and we contrast it with population density data as a proxy for the demand for ESS. The spatially explicit assessment shows that we can distinguish between mountain areas where demand and supply are well balanced from mountain areas where demand and supply are unbalanced. For these different types of mountain regions we suggest different approaches to package the concept of ESS into spatial decision-making.},

Food sovereignty is centrally, though not exclusively, about groups of people making their own decisions about the food system‚Äîit is a way of talking about a theoretically-informed food systems practice. Since people are different, we should expect decisions about food sovereignty to be different in different contexts, albeit consonant with a core set of principles (including women‚Äôs rights, a shared opposition to genetically modified crops, and a demand for agriculture to be removed from current international trade agreements). In this paper we look at the analytical points of friction in applying ideas of food sovereignty within the context of Indigenous struggles in North America. This, we argue, helps to clarify one of the central themes in food sovereignty: that it is a continuation of anti-colonial struggles, even in post-colonial contexts. Such an examination has dividends both for scholars of food sovereignty and for those of Indigenous politics: by helping to problematize notions of food sovereignty and postcoloniality, but also by posing pointed questions around gender for Indigenous struggles.},

A first set of articles examines the role played by the World Bank, the oecd, the European Union and the g7+ coalition of ‚Äòfragile states‚Äô in the transnational diffusion of the concept, which is understood as a critical element in the new discourse on international aid and security. A second set of papers employs three case studies (Sudan, Indonesia and Uganda) to explore the processes of appropriation, reinterpretation and the strategic use of the ‚Äòfragile state‚Äô concept.},

We demonstrate this through an analysis of the contributions to this Special Issue, each of which draws on explicitly Sociological theories and methods to consider futures in a range of fields. Finally, we explore further developments necessary for a Sociology of the Future. We argue that Sociology can and should be more directly involved in claiming what futures might be, should be and in materialising these claims. This means moving beyond Sociology ‚Äì as a distinct set of resources ‚Äì towards expansive engagement with other future-making actors. This may challenge and change Sociology but may also be key to its future.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has moved from a strong focus on mitigation to increasingly address adaptation. Climate change is no longer simply about reducing emissions, but also about enabling countries to deal with its impacts. Yet, most studies of the climate regime have focused on the evolution of mitigation governance and overlooked the increasing number of adaptation-related decisions and initiatives. In this article, we identify the body of rules and commitments on adaptation and suggest that there are more attempts to govern adaptation than many mitigation-focused accounts of the international climate regime would suggest. We then ask: to what degree are adaptation rules and commitments legalized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change? We examine the degree of precision and obligation of relevant decisions through an extensive analysis of primary United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change documents, secondary literature on adaptation initiatives and institutions, interviews with climate change experts and negotiators, and participant observation at climate negotiations. Our analysis finds that adaptation governance is low in precision and obligation. We suggest that this is partly because adaptation is a contested global public good and because ?package deals? are made with mitigation commitments. This article makes a vital contribution to the global environmental politics literature given that adaptation governance is under-studied and poorly understood. It also contributes to the legalization literature by highlighting how contested global public goods may be governed globally, but with low obligation and precision.},

Rather than critiquing master planning, this paper seeks to interrogate its recent rise in urban Africa. Building on a review of international planning trajectories, the paper seeks to challenge dominant narratives in the Western literature around the rise and decline of master planning. Planning experiences from across the African continent illustrate how master planning was a limited practice under colonialism and emerged more strongly in early post-colonial years, while persisting through a quiet period of planning and proliferating in recent times. By exploring the diversity in the influences and approaches to master planning for new and existing cities in Africa over time, the paper positions master planning as the product of a complex array of transnational circuits and multiple local actors and ambitions which intersect across different scales. The study of master planning should therefore be considered as an important entry point into understanding and rethinking the contemporary politics of urban planning, implementation, and development in Africa.},

  abstract = {Due to its probabilistic nature, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is subject to decision errors. The concern for false positives has overshadowed the concern for false negatives in the recent debates in psychology. This might be unwarranted, since reported statistically nonsignificant findings may just be ‚Äòtoo good to be false‚Äô. We examined evidence for false negatives in nonsignificant results in three different ways. We adapted the Fisher test to detect the presence of at least one false negative in a set of statistically nonsignificant results. Simulations show that the adapted Fisher method generally is a powerful method to detect false negatives. We examined evidence for false negatives in the psychology literature in three applications of the adapted Fisher method. These applications indicate that (i) the observed effect size distribution of nonsignificant effects exceeds the expected distribution assuming a null-effect, and approximately two out of three (66.7\%) psychology articles reporting nonsignificant results contain evidence for at least one false negative, (ii) nonsignificant results on gender effects contain evidence of true nonzero effects, and (iii) the statistically nonsignificant replications from the Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) do not warrant strong conclusions about the absence or presence of true zero effects underlying these nonsignificant results. We conclude that false negatives deserve more attention in the current debate on statistical practices in psychology. Potentially neglecting effects due to a lack of statistical power can lead to a waste of research resources and stifle the scientific discovery process.},

We bump into the zombies on their phones in the street, and sometimes they‚Äôre us. We stare in pity at the four people at the table in the restaurant, all on their phones, and then we feel the buzz in our pocket.

Now, as Chris Hayes writes, ‚ÄúWith the help of a few tech firms, we basically tore it down in about a decade.‚Äù Hayes argues that we are in the midst of an epoch-defining transition whose only parallel is what happened to labor in the nineteenth century: attention has become a commodified resource extracted from us, and from which we are increasingly alienated. The Sirens‚Äô Call is the big-picture vision we urgently need to offer clarity and guidance.Because there is a breaking point. Sirens are designed to compel us, and now they are going off in our bedrooms and kitchens at all hours of the day and night, doing the bidding of vast empires, the most valuable companies in history, built on harvesting human attention. As Hayes writes, ‚ÄúNow our deepest neurological structures, human evolutionary inheritances, and social impulses are in a habitat designed to prey upon, to cultivate, distort, or destroy that which most fundamentally makes us human.‚Äù The Sirens‚Äô Call is the book that snaps everything into a single holistic framework so that we can wrest back control of our lives, our politics, and our future.},

  abstract = {Pragmatism and critical realism have been proposed as research philosophies that can be used by development studies researchers as alternatives to the dominant but criticized positivism and constructivism. Pragmatism and critical realism themselves have identified shortcomings for which a number of possible responses have been proposed, including the combination of some elements from each. In this paper, we explore what it would mean not to fully integrate the two but to bring together complementary aspects as a new research paradigm: ‚Äòpragmatist-critical realism‚Äô. We review the philosophical nature of this complementary form but the main contribution here is to show how it could be operationalized. We outline a four-step operational methodology for pragmatist-critical realism based on the Fairwork action research project that has sought to improve working conditions for platform workers in global South countries. We argue that pragmatist-critical realism could provide a useful foundation for development studies research ‚Äì particularly action-oriented research ‚Äì and we encourage other development studies researchers to assess whether it could form a facilitative basis for their future research.},

Insight into the range of available methods and their characteristics will thus help policy analysts to learn more about the potential and limitations involved in analyzing multi-actor processes. This article provides such an overview, based on the main requirements these methods should meet. This overview is used to discuss some of the implications for policy analysts who are interested in analyzing multi-actor processes, focusing specifically on trade-offs between analytic quality and practical usability.},

  abstract = {Violent conflicts are frequently associated with detrimental or neutral effects on economic, social, and en¬≠ vironmental development; by extension, one might expect similar effects on agrobiodiversity. However, as this study suggests, the impacts of conflicts are not necessarily all negative or neutral. Indeed, conflicts may also create favorable political conditions for the implementation of community-driven agrobiodiversity management. Drawing on ethnographic research in the indigenous central region of Chiapas, Mexico, where the insurgent Zapatista movement (EZLN) has a strong influence, we examine the impact of the agrarian conflict between this indigenous movement and the Mexican government on the development of agrobiodiversity conservation in¬≠ itiatives. Two research questions guide this paper: (1) What has been the impact of the conflict on communities‚Äô subsistence agriculture and seed sovereignty? and (2) To what extent has the local seed sovereignty move¬≠ ment‚Äîan outgrowth of the Zapatista conflict‚Äîinfluenced agrobiodiversity conservation? Our findings suggest that the conflict has led to the implementation of grassroots agroecology and food and seed sovereignty projects that could ultimately strengthen agrobiodiversity in the communities under the influence of the Zapatista movement. We suggest that these projects highlight two elements essential for long-term agrobiodiversity conservation: first, the strategic relationship between agrobiodiversity conservation and these communities‚Äô food security and seed sovereignty, particularly in the context of conflict; and second, the central role that peasant communities play in the preservation, reproduction, and evolution of agrobiodiversity. We conclude that the overall long-term impact of the Zapatista conflict on local agrobiodiversity has in fact been positive.},

While the typology does not cover all futures methods, it serves as a helpful tool for academic scholars and practitioners new to the field. It aims to guide readers in identifying suitable methods for their specific questions, activities, and contexts. It begins by summarizing existing classifications of futures studies methods found in academic literature, publicly available foresight toolkits, and other practice-oriented sources, and then presents its own typology based on when to use specific methods to address particular questions. The chapter proposes this typology instead of a taxonomy, as futures work requires adaptability and flexibility. The proposed typology also distinguishes between modality and method, addressing the challenge of classifying purely futures methods versus research approaches used in other disciplines. The chapter then discusses creating new and emerging methods, decolonizing methods, and strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. It also explores emerging approaches for evaluating futures studies and foresight research. The concluding section provides a summary of the chapter‚Äôs approach and offers suggestions for further refinement and codification of methods in futures studies and foresight.},

  abstract = {Biosecurity, as a response to threats from zoonotic, food-borne and emerging infectious diseases, implies and is often understood in terms of a spatial segregation of forms of life, a struggle to separate healthy life from diseased bodies. While an ensuing will to closure in the name of biosecurity is evident at various sites, things are, in practice and in theory, more intricate than this model would suggest. There are transactions and transformations that defy easily segmented spaces. Using multi-species ethnographic work across a range of sites, from wildlife reserves to farms and food processing plants, we argue for a shift of focus in biosecurity away from defined borderlines towards that of borderlands. The latter involves the detachment of borders from geographic territory and highlights the continuous topological interplay and resulting tensions involved in making life live. We use this spatial imagination to call for a different kind of biopolitics and for a shift in what counts as a biosecurity emergency. As a means to re-frame the questions concerning biosecurity, we argue for a change of discourse and practice away from disease ‚Äòbreach points‚Äô towards the ‚Äòtipping points‚Äô that can arise in the intense foldings that characterise pathological lives.},

Yet there is another way to think the connection between war and work. In this article, I ask what it would mean to think of the violence young men in the region's militia movements performed as a mode of post-Fordism. This stands in sharp contrast to recent writing on conflict in Africa, writing that focuses on how violence is a process of identity formation. By contrast, I suggest that ‚Äúidentity‚Äù was not a problematic category for fighters in this war. Their own identities could be comfortably contradictory, and the identities of their enemies were a minor issue at best. What mattered was the work of violence, work that increasingly took on the character of emergent modes of what has been called ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù production.},

First, we argue that ethnicity is a defining political resource in the Congo‚Äôs politics and violent conflicts, which we call ‚Äòethnic capital‚Äô. Second, we argue that the high political value of this ethnic capital is sustained by engrained discourses and practices of ethnicity. These discourses and practices permeate the Congo‚Äôs political order, shape people‚Äôs understanding of politics, conflict and political identities, and have contributed to the formation of an unstable, centrifugal, and fragmentary political order. Third, we argue that conceptualising ethnicity as capital dismantles the artificial dualism between the symbolic realm of identities and the material realm of the economy and makes it possible to move beyond primordialist, instrumentalist and purely symbolic understandings of the nexus between conflict and ethnicity. Ultimately, what is at stake in this competition is the distribution of symbolic and material resources.},

  abstract = {The expansion of middle-income countries in the global South is now widely acknowledged as significant for international development research and practice. But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals ‚Äì SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how ‚Äì if at all ‚Äì the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle-income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador‚Äôs national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers‚Äô engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito‚Äôs local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these ‚Äúpriority‚Äù goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation.},

The present paper aims to problematize this dichotomized understanding of people√É¬¢√¢¬Ç¬¨√¢¬Ñ¬¢s roles in conflict, by locating it within the recent dominant model of transitional justice and demonstrating how it is the result of an inherently political (and disputed) choice, part of the process of constructing post-conflict narratives and dominant discourses on violence and victimhood. Settling for a single conflict story and defining a rigid victim-perpetrator dichotomy can be profoundly excluding and limited in capturing the diversity of victimhood and perpetration experiences, memories and perceptions; and can also (re)produce former and new unequal relations of power. The paper will illustrate this discussion through the case study of post-genocide Rwanda, where a dominant discourse on the 1994 violence has been established, based on a Tutsi victim-Hutu perpetrator dichotomy. The latter not only obscures the plurality of violence and victimization experiences within these groups, but also renders invisible the role of the Twa community. This case aptly illustrates the critique of the often unacknowledged limits and politics of mainstream transitional justice discourse, as well as provides grounds for a deeper reflection on the implications and consequences of leaving these issues unaddressed for countries√É¬¢√¢¬Ç¬¨√¢¬Ñ¬¢ long-term prospects for reconciliation, in particular, Rwanda√É¬¢√¢¬Ç¬¨√¢¬Ñ¬¢s.√É¬Ç√Ç},

The article discusses not only their struggles against economic exploitation, political and cultural oppression, and military violence, therefore, but their role in a revolutionary process that seeks to build a society based on social justice and respect for human rights. Through a peaceful and persistent collective action, they have recovered a large part of their ancestral territories, elevated the level of literacy and conscientization, and revived many aspects of indigenous culture. However, the intensification in militarization and repression that has accompanied neo-liberal economic policies imposed 'from above' has in effect undermined the formal recognition by the Colombian Constitution of their territorial and cultural rights. It is argued here that current mobilization undertaken by indigenous communities is characterized by two interrelated challenges: resistance that is peaceful, plus a failure to transcend locality and to ally with other non-rural anti-systemic movements.},

  abstract = {This article traces how climate has moved from playing a deterministic to a reductionist role in discourses about environment, society, and the future. Climate determinism previously offered an explanation, and hence a justification, for the superiority of certain imperial races and cultures. The argument put forward here is that the new climate reductionism is driven by the hegemony exercised by the predictive natural sciences over contingent, imaginative, and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. It is a hegemony that lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of putative future climates. Some possible reasons for this climate reductionism, as well as some of the limitations and dangers of this position for human relationships with the future, are suggested.},

  abstract = {Climate change resilience is increasingly becoming a policy priority in cities, but the impetus to reduce future climate risks may conflict with existing economic priorities shaping urban development. This study examines how Boston, Massachusetts responded to future sea level rise by adopting a set of policies promoting climate resilience of its waterfront while simultaneously overseeing the rapid development of the Seaport District, a neighbourhood highly vulnerable to flooding. Drawing upon previous scholarship on environmental fixes in entrepreneurial cities, I argue that Boston‚Äôs policy decisions represent a resilience fix in which policymakers selectively adopt climate adaptation strategies that respond to growing evidence of climate-related risks but also perpetuate existing economic growth patterns. This case study contributes to an emerging understanding of resilience fixes by highlighting how they embody political decisions that can ultimately undermine the aims of urban resilience, including long-term adaptation and social equity. The resilience fix framing extends scholarship on the multidimensional nature of urban resilience to highlight how selective interpretation of resilience across spatial, temporal, and social dimensions in urban policy may result in positive changes across some dimensions but create maladaptations along others.},

They share a central concern with organizing work and delivering change. Though international development played a role in defining the project management domain in the 1950s and the 1960s, there has been little cross-fertilization between project management and international development in recent decades. The centrality of projects in international development efforts and the need for project management to help tackle global challenges that overlap with international development, such as climate change and COVID-19, make such cross-learning timely and rewarding. Accordingly, with the aim of cross-fertilization and integration, this paper examines what connects and differentiates the two domains of project management and international development, both conceptually and through the distinctive nature of their modes of delivery. The paper lays out a research agenda for the interface between project management and international development.},

From art museums and university hospitals to think tanks and church charities, over 1.5 million organizations of staggering diversity share the tax-exempt 501(c)(3) designation, if little else. Many social justice organizations have joined this world, often blunting political goals to satisfy government and foundation mandates. But even as funding shrinks, many activists often find it difficult to imagine movement-building outside the non-profit model. The Revolution Will Not Be Funded gathers essays by radical activists, educators, and non-profit staff from around the globe who critically rethink the long-term consequences of what they call the "non-profit industrial complex." Drawing on their own experiences, the contributors track the history of non-profits and provide strategies to transform and work outside them. Urgent and visionary, The Revolution Will Not Be Funded presents a biting critique of the quietly devastating role the non-profit industrial complex plays in managing dissent. Contributors.

  abstract = {The pursuit of adaptation to climate change, both theoretically and practically, has intensified considerably over the past decade in response to increasing awareness of the potential impacts of global climate change. Despite this momentum, the interaction of climate change adaptation with pre-existing strategies to reduce vulnerability and build resilience in the developing world has only recently received significant attention. Using the example of disaster risk reduction, this paper explores the developing interface between climate change adaptation and existing development methodologies that have overlapping interests. While it has been established that there must be greater collaboration between these fields, many questions remain surrounding the scope of such interaction. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and then explores some unanswered questions and developing conceptualizations. An examination of the theoretical points of convergence and divergence raises a range of questions surrounding how climate change adaptation is conceptualized in both the academic literature and the policy environment. There is a rich space to consider pre-existing development pathways within the adaptation narrative. Enhancing adaptive capacity requires robust frameworks that more holistically engage the embedded structures that perpetuate both socio-economic and environmental vulnerability.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the trends, drivers and effects of alcohol consumption in Karamoja, a primarily pastoralist area of Uganda. Although locally brewed alcohol from sorghum and millet has an important and long-standing place in Karamojong tradition, the emerging trend of excessive consumption of hard liquor is a cause for concern among government and health officials, development practitioners and, especially, community members themselves. This article explores the varied reasons for this rise in hard liquor consumption, particularly in Karamoja‚Äôs post-disarmament period. The article is based on data collected in mid-2018, as well as information gleaned from the authors‚Äô engagement in the region over the past decade. The peace and security ushered in by the disarmament exercises of the 2000s has, on the one hand, opened up the once isolated region politically and economically. Conversely, it has accelerated external interest in Karamoja‚Äôs economic wealth, leading to further disenfranchisement of its people due to dispossession of land. Emerging from the trauma of the disarmament exercise, the drastic loss of livestock and livelihoods and the continuing negligence of pastoralism by the state, Karamoja‚Äôs rural as well as peri-urban communities are undergoing a remarkable loss not only of their economic systems, but also of their socio-cultural identity. Acknowledging the specific trauma and loss experienced by individuals and communities provides a lens through which to better understand the excessive alcohol consumption. These psychosocial factors, along with the economic and political aspects, must be considered in efforts to address this continuing crisis in the region.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems provide essential services that form the basis of human well-being. Climate change-induced losses and damages to ecosystem services (l\&d-ES) thus have significant impacts on societies. Yet, little of the work on losses and damages (l\&d) has focused on ecosystem services. Also in international climate negotiations, where the debate emerged with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), there remains space for better understanding and addressing l\&d-ES. Part of the explanation of this lies in the challenge of assessing such l\&d. To address this gap, this paper reviews scientific literature and data obtained from Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNAs) to explore ways forward for more in depth assessments. The review confirms that little attention has been given to the topic, identifying 27 relevant scientific papers with only 6 providing a disaggregated monetary value for l\&d-ES. Also amongst the 64 analyised PDNAs, only 12 report such disaggregated value; valuing just one ecosystem service per impacted ecosystem. The review finds that the majority of both the scientific literature and the PDNAs relies on extrapolating values from the literature. To enhance l\&d-ES assessment and, with that, the opportunity for better understanding, recognition and uptake by e.g. the WIM, this paper makes three recommendations: 1. establishing a baseline of ecosystems recognized for their services of disaster risk reduction and/or climate change adaptation, while highlighting the need for an accessible and representative benefit transfer database; 2. enhancing collaboration between scientists and practitioners; and 3. quantitatively increasing data on l\&d-ES.Key policy insights There remains space for better understanding and addressing l\&d-ES.To facilitate assessing l\&d-ES, the establishment of ecological baselines should be encouraged for ecosystem services that can be reported on in other circumstances.Additionally, a benefit transfer database is needed that is that is geographically and ecologically representative, explicitly oriented towards l\&d-ES, and easily accessible to both researchers and decision-makers.Considering the divergence of ecosystems addressed by different stakeholders, it may be advisable to encourage the collaboration of a wide stakeholder range, including scientists, to collect data that advance the understanding of l\&d-ES.Disaggregated assessment of l\&d-ES should be quantitatively increased and the WIM could encourage the reporting of l\&d-ES, in order to expand the database and understanding of l\&d-ES.},

By testing novel hypotheses rooted in culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory and socioanalytic theory, we offer three unique insights. First, in collectivist societies (cultures that value interdependence with one‚Äôs group), the five factor model traits‚Äîand leader Extraversion and Agreeableness in particular‚Äîare stronger predictors of leader effectiveness, consistent with the theorized need for enhanced social coordination in such cultures. Second, a theoretical model is proposed to specify that leader Big Five trait effects are mediated by leader behavior (confirming that Consideration mediates Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas Initiating Structure mediates Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness). Third, trait Honesty-Humility robustly predicts leader effectiveness beyond the Big Five traits, expanding the trait approach. New implications for understanding when and why personality traits predict leadership are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Geo-political tensions and disruptions to global value chains have led policymakers to re-evaluate their approach to globalisation. Many countries are considering friendshoring ‚Äì trading primarily with countries sharing similar values ‚Äì as a way of minimising exposure to weaponisation of trade and securing access to critical inputs. If followed through, this process has the potential to reverse global economic integration of recent decades. This article estimates the economic costs of friendshoring using a quantitative model incorporating inter-country inter-industry linkages. The results suggest that friendshoring may lead to real GDP losses of up to 4.7\% of GDP in some economies. Thus, although friendshoring may provide insurance against extreme disruptions and increase the security of supply of vital inputs, it would come at a substantial cost.},

  abstract = {This article provides a genealogy and analysis of the concept of a sacrifice zone. Drawing on archival and ethnographic research, the article traces the origins and transformation of sacrifice zones from (1) a livestock and land management concept into (2) a critical energy concept during the 1970s, (3) an Indigenous political ecology concept in the 1980s, and, finally, (4) an environmental justice concept in the 1990s and beyond. The article identifies the concept‚Äôs core content and argues in favor of calling sites of concentrated environmental injustice sacrifice zones, over alternatives such as ‚Äúfenceline communities‚Äù or ‚Äúdumping grounds,‚Äù in part because the concept of sacrifice, derived from the Latin ‚Äúto make sacred,‚Äù is polysemous, signifying both violent victimization and sacred life. This explains why some activists have employed the sacrifice zone concept to generate a positive vision for transforming sacrifice zones into sacred zones. This analysis of the concept‚Äôs development through time, social friction, and geographic mobility advances efforts to broaden environmental justice theory from a focus on distributive justice to critical and constructive engagement with culture and religion. The article pursues one implication of this study by suggesting an amendment to the concept of ‚Äúslow violence‚Äù: environmental injustice is better theorized as ‚Äúslow sacrifice‚Äù‚Äîa political ecology of life and death, the goal of which is to concentrate death in some places so that other places might experience full, sustainable life. Such a theory makes visible a wider set of existing cultural and religious responses to environmental injustices.},

As in the case of other emerging or transitional countries with large natural resource endowments, a key question is whether the exploitation of the natural resource is a benefit to longer term economic development: is it a curse, a blessing ‚Äì or neither? Narrative evidence suggests that the establishment of good governance, in terms of institutions and policies, provides a background to sound long-term development, especially if combined with the development of sectors outside the natural resource sector, for example diversification into manufacturing and services, often through attracting FDI. The narrative is supported by econometric modelling of the relationship between domestic output, overseas output and exports of oil, which finds in favour of a sustained positive effect of oil exports on GDP. The model then provides a basis for projection of the growth in GDP given a consensus view of likely developments in the oil price.},

In Uganda, the basic descriptive information about civil society, its size, area of activity, domestic sources of monetary and material support, and the policy framework in which it operates seem not to be available in an organized way. Civil society (CSOs) structures seem to be superficial and are shadows of the ideal concept of civil society because some of the actors have been compromised, deterred by state while others side with government when they are supposed to provide checks and balances or to promote African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance (ACDEG). Therefore, this article seeks to examine the evolution and role of civil society in Uganda; how the state relates with civil society; factors that influence State-CSOs relationship in the area of advocacy and democracy and whether the theoretical concept of civil society is applicable in Uganda.},

According to some who study the Soviet economy the answer is ‚Äúyes.‚Äù This view has been succinctly expressed by Stanley Cohn: ‚ÄúAfter 1937, the rising spectre of Hitler forced the Soviet leadership to shift resources into armaments on a massive scale. As a result, the growth rate fell drastically to 3.6 percent per year between 1937 and 1940.‚Äù Such a sequence of events, however, has never been empirically demonstrated. The purpose of this paper is to investigate formally the validity of this explanation, via aggregate production functions, particularly of the CES (constant elasticity of substitution) variety, as well as to explore an alternative hypothesis, espoused, among others, by Naum Jasny, Alec Nove and Warren Nutter. This hypothesis stresses a domestic factor as the major contributor to the disruption in industrial production: namely, the impact of Stalin's terror in the form of chaos-producing political purges.},

The successful institution of Talanoa Dialogues at UN climate change meetings was not just a branding exercise, but an ideological project of encompassment. Although the Solomon Islands has a lower international profile, its responses to climate change suggest new ways of thinking about the relationship between local environmental knowledge and scientific models, and provides valuable feedback on new forms of aid focused on adaptation.

What if that double shared many of your preoccupations but, in a twisted, upside-down way, furthered the very causes you'd devoted your life to fighting against? Not long ago, the celebrated activist and public intellectual Naomi Klein had just such an experience--she was confronted with a doppelganger whose views she found abhorrent but whose name and public persona were sufficiently similar to her own that many people got confused about who was who. Destabilized, she lost her bearings, until she began to understand the experience as one manifestation of a strangeness many of us have come to know but struggle to define: AI-generated text is blurring the line between genuine and spurious communication; New Age wellness entrepreneurs turned anti-vaxxers are scrambling familiar political allegiances of left and right; and liberal democracies are teetering on the edge of absurdist authoritarianism, even as the oceans rise. Under such conditions, reality itself seems to have become unmoored. Is there a cure for our moment of collective vertigo? Naomi Klein is one of our most trenchant and influential social critics, an essential analyst of what branding, austerity, and climate profiteering have done to our societies and souls. Here she turns her gaze inward to our psychic landscapes, and outward to the possibilities for building hope amid intersecting economic, medical, and political crises. With the assistance of Sigmund Freud, Jordan Peele, Alfred Hitchcock, and bell hooks, among other accomplices, Klein uses wry humor and a keen sense of the ridiculous to face the strange doubles that haunt us - and that have come to feel as intimate and proximate as a warped reflection in the mirror. Combining comic memoir with chilling reportage and cobweb-clearing analysis, Klein seeks to smash that mirror and chart a path beyond despair. Doppelganger asks: What do we neglect as we polish and perfect our digital reflections? Is it possible to dispose of our doubles and overcome the pathologies of a culture of multiplication? Can we create a politics of collective care and undertake a true reckoning with historical crimes? The result is a revelatory treatment of the way many of us think and feel now - and an intellectual adventure story for our times" - (Provided by publisher)},

After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, the entire country has a national housing crisis. After years of slashing immigration, we don‚Äôt have enough workers. After decades of off-shoring manufacturing, we have a shortage of chips for cars and computers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven‚Äôt built anything close to the clean energy infrastructure we need. The crisis that‚Äôs clicking into focus now has been building for decades‚Äîbecause we haven‚Äôt been building enough. Abundance explains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear‚Äôs villains. Rather, one generation‚Äôs solutions have become the next generation‚Äôs problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the environmental problems of the 1970s often prevent urban density and green energy projects that would help solve the environmental problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions in matters of education and healthcare have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished. Progress requires the ability to see promise rather than just peril in the creation of new ideas and projects, and an instinct to design systems and institutions that make building possible. In a book exploring how can move from a liberalism that not only protects and preserves but also builds, Klein and Thompson trace the political, economic, and cultural barriers to progress and how we can adopt a mindset directed toward abundance, and not scarcity, to overcome them.},

  abstract = {Often called paratransit because of their flexible stops, schedules and routes, minibuses make up the bulk of public transport in African cities. Despite their ubiquity and importance, these systems are poorly understood by transportation planners who tend to focus on large-scale urban infrastructure projects such as highways, commuter rail or bus rapid transit systems. The assumption within much of this planning is that these minibus systems are barriers to change and will become at most secondary ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù buses within large-scale projects, but structured plans detailing this vision are lacking. This paper argues that frequent failure to collect data and value important paratransit systems as a critical part of transportation in their own right is deeply problematic from the point of view of equity, access and inclusive and effective planning. We ask whether the growing number of bottom up mapping projects of minibus systems can disrupt this status quo. By comparing two mapping projects, Digital Matatus in Nairobi and the Mapa Dos Chapas in Maputo, we find that inclusive, collaborative mapping can help render these minibuses more visible in planning and provoke more grounded and inclusive ‚Äúplanning conversations‚Äù on multi-modal integration, passenger information and minibus upgrading, all key but relatively marginalised aspects of creating accessible, low emission, high quality and safe public transport in African cities.},

  abstract = {This study provides a more robust understanding of the role natural resources play in civil war outbreaks and incidence. Its point of departure is the feasibility hypothesis, according to which the presence of natural resources alters the financial opportunity structure in favor of rebel groups. Rendering seven different dimensions of ‚Äúlootability‚Äù and ‚Äúobstructability‚Äù explicitly, a ‚Äòmost-likely‚Äô sample of sub-Saharan Africa was used to test those concepts empirically by employing logit models. The results point to the most important dimension being value-to-weight ratio. Resources that are small and can be easily traded increase the probability of civil war incidence. Furthermore, military support for insurgent groups, a common theme in sub-Saharan Africa, appears to be correlated with the presence of high value-to-weight resources. In contrast, other dimensions, such as the mode of transport, seem to have no independent bearing on the explanation of civil war outbreak.},

  abstract = {The ‚Äòsoftening‚Äô of the budget constraint appears when the strict relationship between the expenditure and the earnings of an economic unit (firm, household, etc.) has been relaxed, because excess expenditure will be paid by some other institution, typically be the paternalistic State. The higher the subjective probability that excess expenditure will be covered by external assistance, the softer the budget constraint. The main focus of the paper is on the firm. There are several ways of ‚Äòsoftening‚Äô the budget constraint: subsidies, tax-exemptions, soft credits and so on. The softness weakens price responsiveness, leads to losses in efficiency and under certain conditions may generate excess demand. The paper examines the ‚Äòsoft budget constraint‚Äô syndrome in Hungary, Yugoslavia, and China, i.e. in the economies pioneering in the introduction of market-oriented decentralization reforms. Socialist economies exhibit a rather extreme degree of this phenomenon, which to a lesser degree can be observed in mixed economies as well. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die ‚ÄúAufweichung‚Äù der Budgetrestriktionen zeigt sich, wenn der enge Zusammen-hang zwischen den Ausgaben und Einnahmen einer Wirtschaftseinheit (Firma, Haus-halt usw.) sich auflockert, weil die Mehrausgabe von einer anderen Institution, im typischen Falle vom paternalistischen Staat gedeckt wird. Je h√∂her die subjektive Wahrscheinlichkeit ist, dass die Mehrausgabe durch eine aussenstehende Hilfsquelle gedeckt wird, um so weicher ist die Budgetrestriktion. Im Mittelpunkt dieser Abhand-lung steht das Unternehmen. Es gibt mehrere M√∂glichkeiten zur ‚ÄúAufweichung‚Äù der Budgetrestriktion: Subventionen, Steuerfreiheit, weiche Kredite usw. Die Weiche schw√§cht die Preissensibilit√§t, f√ºhrt zu Verlusten in der Wirksamkeit, und unter gewissen Umst√§nden kann eine Mehrnachfrage herbeigef√ºhrt werden. Die Abhand-lung untersucht das Phanomen der ‚Äúweichen Budgetrestriktion‚Äù in Ungarn, Jugosla-wien und China, das heisst in den Wirtschaften, die in der Einf√ºhrung von marktorien-tierten Dezentralisationsreformen bahnbrechend sind. Die sozialistischen Wirtschaften weisen einen ziemlich hohen Grad dieses Ph√§nomens auf, das in geringerem Masse auch in gemischten Wirtschaften zu beobachten ist. R√âSUM√â L'adoucissement‚Äù de la contrainte budg√©taire appara√Æt lors du rel√¢chement de la stricte relation entre les d√©penses et les recettes d'une unit√©√©conomique (entreprise, m√©nage‚Ä¶). Cela survient quand l'exc√©s de d√©penses est pris en charge par une autre institution, l'exemple type en √©tant l'Etat-Providence. II existe plusieurs fa√ßons ‚Äúd'adoucir‚Äù la contrainte budg√©taire: les subventions, les abattements fiscaux, les cr√©dits bonifi√©s, etc. Cet adoucissement affaiblit la capacity√© de r√©ponse par les prix, il conduit √† des pertes d'efficacit√©, et, dans certaines conditions, peut engendrer un exc√®s de demande. On peut contempler le stade ultime de ce ph√©nom√®ne dans les √©conomies socialistes, mais les √©conomies mixtes en pr√©sentent certains sympt√¥mes. L'auteur examine le syndr√¥me de ‚Äúl'adoucissement‚Äù de la contrainte budg√©taire en Hongrie, en Yougoslavie et en Chine, c'est-√†-dire dans les √©conomies socialistes qui, les premier√®s, ont tent√© une certaine d√©centralisation √©conomique.},

This new framework places the goals of direct democracy, local and bioregional economies, cultural diversity, human well-being, and ecological resilience at the core of its vision. It arises from the myriad grassroots initiatives that have sprung up in India and other parts of the world. Although efforts to amplify and spread such a paradigm face the enormous challenge of overcoming the resistance of entrenched institutions and mindsets, current practice suggests opportunities for making progress. Ultimately, the wide embrace of radical ecological democracy will require the spread of the core values underlying the framework, a transition guided not only by hard-headed rationality but also by a strong ethical and emotional foundation.},

The conference provided a venue for reviewing earlier developments and reevaluating prospective directions in the futures field. Scientific-based futures studies has a long history, drawing from a variety of fields including sociology, policy sciences, philosophy of science, economic prognostics, and environmental sustainability. Futures studies became widely acknowledged as an academic discipline in the 1960s when it became evident in the global scientific community. The 1970s saw a focus on global challenges and discussions about preferred futures. The synthesis of futures studies emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, with critical and evolutionary approaches contributing to the advancement of theoretical foundations. The twenty-first century focuses on anticipation and futures literacy, the development of post-normal, metamodern, and integral approaches, and the attainment of foresight in common practice. Future research is expected to focus on various aspects, including artificial general intelligence (AGI), socio-technical transitions, singularity, sustainability, societal collapses, entrepreneurial innovation, energy futures, decolonization, negation and post-prefix notions, systemic foresight, applied foresight, and on-site foresight. Future research activities are expected to also include research objects, policy challenges, and problems that do not yet exist.},

The author argues that excessive violence is commonly misunderstood and misrepresented as dehumanization because it seems to aim at effacing the victim's human appearance. Yet, it is more accurate to see such violence as a ploy to extend the perpetrator's sense of power over another human being; it is precisely the human quality of the interaction that provides the violence with much of its meaning. The argument has a moral edge, demonstrating that the concept ultimately reduces, or displaces, the true horror of the killer-victim interaction.},

  abstract = {Climate policy has thus far focused solely on carbon stocks and sequestration to evaluate the potential of forests to mitigate global warming. These factors are used to assess the impacts of different drivers of deforestation and forest degradation as well as alternative forest management. However, when forest cover, structure and composition change, shifts in biophysical processes (the water and energy balances) may enhance or diminish the climate effects of carbon released from forest aboveground biomass. The net climate impact of carbon effects and biophysical effects determines outcomes for forest and agricultural species as well as the humans who depend on them. Evaluating the net impact is complicated by the disparate spatio-temporal scales at which they operate. Here we review the biophysical mechanisms by which forests influence climate and synthesize recent work on the biophysical climate forcing of forests across latitudes. We then combine published data on the biophysical effects of deforestation on climate by latitude with a new analysis of the climate impact of the CO2 in forest aboveground biomass by latitude to quantitatively assess how these processes combine to shape local and global climate. We find that tropical deforestation leads to strong net global warming as a result of both CO2 and biophysical effects. From the tropics to a point between 30¬∞N and 40¬∞N, biophysical cooling by standing forests is both local and global, adding to the global cooling effect of CO2 sequestered by forests. In the mid-latitudes up to 50¬∞N, deforestation leads to modest net global warming as warming from released forest carbon outweighs a small opposing biophysical cooling. Beyond 50¬∞N large scale deforestation leads to a net global cooling due to the dominance of biophysical processes (particularly increased albedo) over warming from CO2 released. Locally at all latitudes, forest biophysical impacts far outweigh CO2 effects, promoting local climate stability by reducing extreme temperatures in all seasons and times of day. The importance of forests for both global climate change mitigation and local adaptation by human and non-human species is not adequately captured by current carbon-centric metrics, particularly in the context of future climate warming.},

This article discusses some of the limitations of conventional arguments linking wars and resources. Dominated by econometric approaches and rational choice theory interpretations, arguments pertaining to ‚Äúresource wars‚Äù often oversimplify or overlook the geographical dimensions of resource-related conflicts. By defining spatiality primarily in terms of the location of resource reserves and flows generating revenues for belligerents, these approaches overlook other geographical aspects of resources crucial to conflicts. Focusing on ‚Äúconflict diamonds‚Äù and drawing on recent international relations works and geographical research on the political ecology of violence, commodity chains, and consumption, the article presents an alternative conceptual framework engaging with resource-related spaces of vulnerability, risk, and opportunity for conflicts. This framework, in turn, highlights policy biases resulting from oversimplified readings of ‚Äúresource war‚Äù geographies.},

This article addresses a critical gap in the literature, outlining a framework for ethical peace research broadly encompassed in three guiding principles: responsibility, reciprocity and reflexivity. The first section provides an overview of the ethics of peace action and research, introducing key contributions that practitioner-scholars have made to the ethics of peacebuilding. In the second section, I explore how the guiding principles of reflexivity, responsibility and reciprocity offer a flexible framework for engaging in everyday ethical research practices. I conclude with preliminary recommendations to encourage further conversation about the ethics of peace research, offering ideas for future action.},

  abstract = {The voluntary carbon market allows participants to go beyond regulatory carbon offsetting. Recent developments have improved the transparency and credibility of voluntary carbon trading, and forest carbon credit transactions constitute more than half of trade volume. Its workings, however, have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This study analyses the characteristics of forest carbon credit transactions in the voluntary carbon market using frequency analysis and logistic regression analysis. The results reveal that the co-benefits of forest carbon projects are an important factor influencing carbon credit transactions. From the higher transaction ratio of credits from CCB Standards-labelled projects and projects using co-benefit-oriented standards, it can be inferred that credits with potential for co-benefits (e.g. fostered corporate social responsibility, social cohesion of local communities and voluntary leadership, and positive environmental impacts) are preferred to those focusing exclusively on emission reduction in the voluntary carbon market. The findings of this study suggest that developing co-benefits is important for strengthening the market competitiveness of forest carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. Additionally, unlike the compliance carbon market, in the voluntary carbon market stringent carbon standards do not always guarantee credit transaction performance. POLICY RELEVANCE After UNFCCC COP-21, the global society agreed to acknowledge various forms of international carbon crediting mechanisms, and noted the significance of greenhouse gas emissions reduction for sustainable development and environmental integrity through the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the agreement encouraged both REDD+ activities in developing countries and supports from developed countries. Additionally, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are important for credit transaction in the global voluntary carbon market. Under the new climate regime, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are expected to gain attention in the carbon market. To promote the social, economic, and environmental co-benefits of forest carbon projects, the introduction of an objective co-benefit assessment and certification system should be reviewed at the national level.},

This process will entail a series of scenarios (from short-term, behavioral adjustments to longer-term, ecological impacts) that are impossible to recreate faithfully; either because of their intrinsic infeasibility, or because of ethical constraints associated with human test subjects. Necessarily, we must instead rely on analogs or models. We argue that the best model for solar system colonization is that provided by island settlement by humans during the Holocene. Despite the behavioral and ecodynamic outcomes of the human colonization of islands being relatively well-understood, there has been no systematic attempt to utilize this information to inform space exploration. The outcomes of such an attempt are likely to provide a more concrete understanding of future off-planet human activity and the associated implications.},

The results show that increasing the line length and vehicles of public transport can significantly reduce carbon emissions. Both public transport ridership attraction and private car ownership ratio serve as mediators in the relationship between public transport development and carbon emission reduction. The key difference is that public transport ridership attraction shows a partial mediation effect, while private car ownership ratio demonstrates a suppression effect.

As carceral junctions, migration detention camps serve to identify, confine, symbolically punish and expel people deemed ‚Äòout of place‚Äô in the national order of things. As bordering mechanisms, they are techniques of sorting and controlling populations, and sites where we can observe the enforcement of state racism. These processes of racialisation and expulsion operate corporally and affectively. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with prison officers working inside Denmark's migration-related detention camp, and engaging with the literature on race, emotion and border criminology, the article traces the role of racial affect in forging the identities of people interacting inside the camp. It demonstrates how prison officers‚Äô racialised suspicion, compromised compassion, and passionate nationalism partake in making incarcerated migrants into expellable subjects, and in ordering them in accordance with matrices of racial differentiation. The officers‚Äô emotions, I argue, should be understood as part of the camp's infrastructure, and productive for the border regime.},

  abstract = {The concept of ‚ÄòIndustry‚Äôs Going Upstairs (IGU)‚Äô represents an innovative usage of industrial land that transfers the enterprises‚Äô production to high-rise industrial buildings. It is emerging in the developed areas of eastern China. This study discusses IGU policies to promote local economic development and conducts an empirical test using Guangdong city-level data and a difference-in-differences model. Theoretical analysis shows that IGU can broaden the development space of enterprises and realise industrial and labour agglomeration under supporting policies provided by local governments. The empirical results demonstrate that IGU can improve land-use efficiency and promote local industrial development. IGU is a feasible approach for addressing the current shortage of industrial land in China and is worthy of promotion and replication in other regions.},

  abstract = {The concept of a x-minute (or 15-minute) city has recently gained prominence as an influential urban planning approach. Recent research showed how American, Canadian, and Australian cities operationalized the concept differently using diverse temporal cut-off values and types of destinations. Despite this, there has been little effort to understand how different 15-minute city policies are comparable, and to what extent physical elements in cities can affect realizing the concept. To address this gap, this study aims to understand parallels and differences between these policies while understanding the impacts of the city‚Äôs structuring elements on the probability of achieving them. Using a wide array of spatial and transportation data for the City of Saskatoon, the paper develops five different 15-minute city policies based on four different city plans at the parcel level. Using summary statistics and multilevel logistic regressions previous policies were analyzed. The study shows considerable differences between policies in terms of the conclusions they convey. For example, different policies led to diverse results regarding their relationship with people‚Äôs socioeconomic issues, and thereby equity assessment. Additionally, the study shows that some physical elements such as highways, large parks, and rail lines have a consistent negative impact on the probability of realizing 15-minute city goals, regardless of the used policy. Other elements had a mixed effect according to the used policy. This study offers cities a better understanding of the performance of different 15-minute city policies and the relative challenges in realizing them, helping cities achieve their broader sustainability and equity goals.},

Africa has no shortage of institutions which attempt to exercise public authority: not only are multiple layers and branches of government institutions present and active to various degrees, but so-called traditional institutions bolstered by government recognition also vie for public authority, and new emerging institutions and organizations also enter the field. The practices of these institutions make concepts such as public authority, legitimacy, belonging, citizenship and territory highly relevant. This article proposes an analytical strategy for the understanding of public authority in such contexts. It draws on research from anthropologists, geographers, political scientists and social scientists working on Africa, in an attempt to explore a set of questions related to a variety of political practices and their institutional ramifications.},

For several years especially Novatek expanded. More recently, Rosneft has emerged as a key player, not least through its purchase of TNK-BP. This article begins with an overview of the companies in the Russian gas sector, their resource bases and capacities, and subsequently examines whether differences in field development costs and export market access may make it rational for Gazprom to continue ceding market share to the NGPs. With rising costs of Gazprom's queue of greenfield developments, any delays in Gazprom's investment program may be compensated through increased NGP production. The article argues that the NGPs are ready to fill the gap, may be allowed to do so and are already increasing their market share in an increasingly competitive market. The stage may now be set for a continued gradual transformation of the Russian gas market, in which the interests of Gazprom and the NGPs may be complementary or may be pitted against each other, but those of the Russian Federation are in any case likely to be better fulfilled than in the past.},

Smith‚Äôs work on institutional ethnography, it aims to recreate the working practices and experiences of those who worked in or around the ANC office in Stockholm using interviews, auto/biographical and organisational sources. In doing so, the article examines the role that the ANC in Sweden played in transnational anti-apartheid activism and solidarity politics, and the specificities that allowed this small group of individuals to have a much larger impact on the struggle against apartheid than might be first assumed. Sweden‚Äôs financial and moral support for the ANC is an important factor, as is its developed welfare state that afforded exiles some stability in times of precarity.},

Moreover, we find large disparities in potential effect between different sports.

For skiing and ice-skating, we find a stronger effect in providing the possibility to store gear at the activity location.

The article conceptualizes how this hybrid or composite peace is constructed and maintained. It proposes a four-part conceptual model to help visualize the interplay that leads to hybridized forms of peace. Hybrid peace is the result of the interplay of the following: the compliance powers of liberal peace agents, networks and structures; the incentivizing powers of liberal peace agents, networks and structures; the ability of local actors to resist, ignore or adapt liberal peace interventions; and the ability of local actors, networks and structures to present and maintain alternative forms of peacemaking.},

The study uses primary data collected through household surveys from two districts in the mid-hills of Nepal to analyze aspects of women‚Äôs roles and responsibilities that are expected to change in the absence of male household heads. Specifically, the study focuses on the change in women‚Äôs workload, the expansion of their roles, their ownership and access to productive resources, and the part they play in household decision making. The results suggest that women have broadened and deepened their involvement in rural society as a result of male out-migration, which could lead to either the empowerment or disempowerment of women. The nature and extent of this impact was conditional on the migration pattern and the remittances received by the households. Larger remittances generally helped to reduce the physical work burden and to increase decision-making roles, thus empowering the women left behind. But low remittances had the opposite impact, and saddled them with greater physical workload.},

Not only are there no established specialised journals or professional organisations within sociology that focus exclusively on warfare but there are very few, if any, books and journal articles that study the relationship between social structure, agency and wars or other forms of organised violence. Unlike political science, anthropology, geography, international relations, security studies and military history where warfare and violence receive extensive coverage resulting in numerous books and articles and well developed research paradigms, contemporary sociology has little to offer in this regard. This is not to say that there are no individual sociologists who study war and violence or that these topics have not been tackled by those within sociology whose research interests lie primarily elsewhere. The point is that contemporary mainstream sociology, unlike its classical predecessors, remains intractable in its near absolute ignoring of warfare. Such obdurateness has resulted in the complete marginalisation of the research field, even though its focus is one of the most important sociological phenomena that has profoundly shaped the history of human sociality: warfare. Moreover, this neglect within the discipline has created a situation where an overwhelming number of studies dealing with warfare and organised violence lack any sociological grounding.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ways in which maritime labor, maritime risk, and seafarers‚Äô survival are embedded in the financial logics and practices of the global shipping industry. By employing the notion of ‚Äúexistential arbitrage,‚Äù the ethnography moves through the pursuit of global profit to the value of labor as a commodity, human and financial risk, and ultimately the value of human lives, all of which are arbitraged. Arbitrage is a profit strategy that is based on a belief in the equalizing power of the market yet is predicated on and creates difference among commodities in order to create opportunities to generate profit. Existential arbitrage brings anthropological studies of security and conflict and trade and finance together. By taking the interdependence of these subfields seriously and showing how the relationship between them manifests itself in practice, the notion of existential arbitrage uncovers a brutal financial trading strategy that requires and forces the oscillation between notions of valuable life and the valuation of labor commodities in a competitive global market.},

  abstract = {Prominent sociopsychological approaches interpret collective victimhood as inseparable, central characteristic of societies involved in intractable conflicts. Victimhood is broadly perceived as an essential conflict-supportive belief also in other disciplines. In the context of Israel, there is a cross-disciplinary consensus that collective victimhood is the country's foundational identity. This project argues that states' employment of this theme changes and is context dependent. It discusses under what conditions Israel's political elites incorporate victim narratives towards armed conflicts. It examines public communication during the 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense (OPD) and the Yom Kippur war of 1973 (YKW). Employing a modified method of narrative conceptualization analysis, the research demonstrates that victim narratives were used almost twice as much during OPD than during YKW. The findings suggest that we need to differentiate between the role these narratives play for collectives versus states. For the latter, the presence of victim narratives is highly variable and reflects strategic developments. The project is the first systematic study exposing that victim narratives can be a challenge for governance. By conceptualizing victim narratives as claims, it captures the dynamic, contextual characteristics of collective victimhood in state affairs offering a theoretical tool for understanding the political dimension of this identification.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence shows that climate change is leading to irreversible and existential impacts on vulnerable communities and countries across the globe. Among other effects, this has given rise to public debate and engagement around notions of climate crisis and emergency. The Loss and Damage (L\&D) policy debate has emphasized these aspects over the last three decades. Yet, despite institutionalization through an article on L\&D by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the Paris Agreement, the debate has remained vague, particularly with reference to its remit and relationship to adaptation policy and practice. Research has recently made important strides forward in terms of developing a science perspective on L\&D. This article reviews insights derived from recent publications by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others, and presents the implications for science and policy. Emerging evidence on hard and soft adaptation limits in certain systems, sectors and regions holds the potential to further build momentum for climate policy to live up to the Paris ambition of stringent emission reductions and to increase efforts to support the most vulnerable. L\&D policy may want to consider actions to extend soft adaptation limits and spur transformational, that is, nonstandard risk management and adaptation, so that limits are not breached. Financial, technical, and legal support would be appropriate for instances where hard limits are transgressed. Research is well positioned to further develop robust evidence on critical and relevant risks at scale in the most vulnerable countries and communities, as well as options to reduce barriers and limits to adaptation.},

Housing in London and Melbourne, our two case study sites, is an essential locus for the domestic waste regime, and apartments are anomalies that disrupt it. Overall, recycling rates are lower in apartments, and comingled stream contamination rates where they exist are relatively higher. Rather than assuming this is a product of household behavior, we take the starting point that socio-material dynamics are at play that make apartments and apartment living incompatible with dominant waste regimes. We construct and apply a practice-based spatio-temporal rhythmic framework, in which recycling is analyzed as a social practice and apartments as the site of the social, leading to two main insights. First, the spatio-temporal dimensions of more than material and more than waste relationships add to the insights that practice theory can provide on the importance of mundane urban domestic processes of waste management by pointing to unevenness. Second, spatio-temporal rhythms analysis also assists in identifying possibilities for purposive attempts to intervene at various scales of waste governance.},

A nonfiction thriller - equal parts The China Syndrome and Mission Impossible' New York Times An epic account of the decades-long battle to control the world's most critical resource-microchip technology Power in the modern world - military, economic, geopolitical - is built on a foundation of computer chips. America has maintained its lead as a superpower because it has dominated advances in computer chips and all the technology that chips have enabled. (Virtually everything runs on chips: cars, phones, the stock market, even the electric grid.) Now that edge is in danger of slipping, undermined by the na√Øve assumption that globalising the chip industry and letting players in Taiwan, Korea and Europe take over manufacturing serves America's interests. Currently, as Chip War reveals, China, which spends more on chips than any other product, is pouring billions into a chip-building Manhattan Project to catch up to the US. In Chip War economic historian Chris Miller recounts the fascinating sequence of events that led to the United States perfecting chip design, and how faster chips helped defeat the Soviet Union (by rendering the Russians' arsenal of precision-guided weapons obsolete). The battle to control this industry will shape our future. China spends more money importing chips than buying oil, and they are China's greatest external vulnerability as they are fundamentally reliant on foreign chips. But with 37 per cent of the global supply of chips being made in Taiwan, within easy range of Chinese missiles, the West's fear is that a solution may be close at hand. 'A riveting history.

  abstract = {Recently, various discussions, solutions, data, and methods related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been posted in online forum communities. Although a vast amount of posting on COVID-19 analytical projects are available in the online forum communities, much of them remain untapped due to limited overview and profiling that focuses on COVID-19 analytic techniques. Thus, it is quite challenging for information diggers and researchers to distinguish the recent trends and challenges of COVID-19 analytic for initiating different and critical studies to fight against the coronavirus. This paper presents the findings of a study that executed a web mining process on COVID-19 data analytical projects from the Stack Overflow and GitHub online community platforms for data scientists. This study provides an insight on what activities can be conducted by novice researchers and others who are interested in data analysis, especially in sentiment analysis. The classification results via Na√Øve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) have returned high accuracy, indicating that the constructed model is efficient in classifying the sentiment data of COVID-19. The findings reported in this paper not only enhance the understanding of COVID-19 related content and analysis but also provides promising framework that can be applied in diverse contexts and domains.},

Among these the encounter with international development has perhaps been longer and more intimate than any of the others. Anthropologists have drawn critical attention to the interfaces and social effects of development's discursive regimes but, oddly enough, have paid scant attention to knowledge producers themselves, despite anthropologists being among them. This is the focus of this volume. It concerns the construction and transmission of knowledge about global poverty and its reduction but is equally interested in the social life of development professionals, in the capacity of ideas to mediate relationships, in networks of experts and communities of aid workers, and in the dilemmas of maintaining professional identities. Going well beyond obsolete debates about 'pure' and 'applied' anthropology, the book examines the transformations that occur as social scientific concepts and practices cross and re-cross the boundary between anthropological and policy making knowledge."--Publisher's website},

The concept is often considered an urban planning ideal that can effectively contribute to improved accessibility and a more sustainable mobility. Through a sustainability, equity, and livability lens, this paper examines pitfalls of the 15-minute city from a theoretical and spatial analysis perspective and proposes alternative theoretical and methodological directions. The seven pitfalls of the 15-minute city in current literature are summarized as: (1) overstatement of the 15-minute city's originality, (2) strong decentralization proposed by the 15-minute city theory is unrealistic and unsustainable, (3) focusing on quantity of destinations instead of sufficiency, (4) improperly aggregating facilities, (5) neglecting diverse forms of nature and their characteristics, (6) disregarding public transport in 15-minute city theory or spatial analysis, and (7) ignoring interpersonal differences in walking and cycling when conducting analyses based on the 15-minute city. A set of strategies is proposed to address these pitfalls and reorient the 15-minute city towards improved environmental and societal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is about planning for the future while responding to current pressures and challenges. Adaptation scientists are increasingly using future visioning exercises embedded in co-production and co-development techniques to assist stakeholders in imagining futures in a changing climate. Even if these exercises are growing in popularity, surprisingly little scrutiny has been placed on understanding the fundamental assumptions and choices in scenario approaches, timeframes, scales, or methods, and whether they result in meaningful changes in how adaptation is being thought about. Here, we unpack key insights and experiences across 62 case studies that specifically report on using future visioning exercises to engage stakeholders in climate change adaptation. We focus on three key areas: 1) Stakeholder diversity and scales; 2) Tools, methods, and data, and 3) Practical constraints, enablers, and outcomes. Our results show that most studies focus on the regional scale (n~=~32; 52\%), involve mainly formal decision makers and employ vast array of different methods, tools, and data. Interestingly, most exercises adopt either predictive (what will happen) and explorative (what could happen) scenarios while only a fraction use the more normative (what should happen) scenarios that could enable more transformative thinking. Reported positive outcomes include demonstrated increases in climate change literacy and support for climate change adaptation planning. Unintended and unexpected outcomes include increased anxiety in cases where introduced timeframes go beyond an individual‚Äôs expected life span and decreased perceived necessity for undertaking adaptation at all. Key agreed factors that underpin co-production and equal representation, such as gender, age, and diversity, are not well reported, and most case studies do not use reflective processes to harness participant feedback that could enable more robust methodology development. This is a missed opportunity in developing a more fundamental understanding of how these exercises can effectively shift individual and collective mindsets and advance the inclusion of different viewpoints as a pathway for more equitable and just climate adaptation.},

To assess the accuracy of this picture, we analyzed the operations and economics of Kampala's minibus taxi system and its efficiency from the passengers' and the drivers' perspectives, using ‚Äòfloating car data‚Äô. We found that the picture is largely accurate. Our findings suggest the need for moderate transformation: adequate enforcement of regulations, reorganization of ownership, renewal of fleets, and integration of ICT systems to facilitate scheduling, booking and fare collection. This will help to make the system safer, cleaner and more efficient for Kampalan commuters and more stable, secure and profitable for the minibus taxi drivers and the mini industries that depend on them.},

  abstract = {A complex political economy revolves around shared land and water use between Kenyan Turkana and Ugandan Karamojong pastoralists. In response to growing pressure on resources, donors and the Ugandan government are investing in new surface water sources. However, power and political economy issues embedded within societal relationships are rarely factored into water infrastructure development. Drawing on Tony Allan‚Äôs teaching, we examine studies of two dams recently constructed in Karamoja and argue that a wider view encompassing power and politics within the Karamoja‚ÄìTurkana Complex would help ensure more sustainable and effective future water supply development. Allan‚Äôs idea that catchments are part of much wider social, political economic and integrated livelihood systems, or problemsheds, is a key concept. Here we argue that adopting this concept in a complex of pastoral systems can improve future water resources planning and intervention in Karamoja, Uganda and similar contexts.},

  abstract = {This article surveys the use of the term ‚Äògenocide‚Äô before, during and after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. The article argues that although ‚Äògenocide‚Äô remains an important legal and analytical concept, an excessive focus on this term represents a misguided and counterproductive approach to the analysis of mass violence. Discussions revolving around a ‚Äògenocide or not‚Äô dichotomy do not further our understanding of the Bosnian war, and are in their essence more connected to desires for past and future international military interventions and to internal Bosnian political struggles than to a scholarly agenda. The ongoing obsession with the label of ‚Äògenocide‚Äô has distortive effects on international criminal justice, because anything less than a genocide conviction is counted as a ‚Äòfailure.‚Äô Recent scholarly accusations that international legal findings of crimes other than genocide constitute ‚Äògenocide denial‚Äô are particularly troubling. In Bosnia, the disproportionate attention on genocide helps to perpetuate the zero-sum approach that has informed Bosniak‚ÄìSerb political negotiations since the end of the war, and more recently the issue of ‚Äògenocide‚Äô has also aggravated relations within the Bosniak community. Ultimately, therefore, it may be more productive to move beyond what has become a myopic focus on genocide.},

  abstract = {Climate change research is at an impasse. The transformation of economies and everyday practices is more urgent, and yet appears ever more daunting as attempts at behaviour change, regulations, and global agreements confront material and social-political infrastructures that support the status quo. Effective action requires new ways of conceptualizing society, climate and environment and yet current research struggles to break free of established categories. In response, this contribution revisits important insights from the social sciences and humanities on the co-production of political economies, cultures, societies and biophysical relations and shows the possibilities for ontological pluralism to open up for new imaginations. Its intention is to help generate a different framing of socionatural change that goes beyond the current science-policy-behavioural change pathway. It puts forward several moments of inadvertent concealment in contemporary debates that stem directly from the way issues are framed and imagined in contemporary discourses. By placing values, normative commitments, and experiential and plural ways of knowing from around the world at the centre of climate knowledge, we confront climate change with contested politics and the everyday foundations of action rather than just data.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called ‚Äúco-pilot model,‚Äù and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one‚Äôs own manuscript or during the review process.},

  abstract = {Since the declaration of the Diaspora as Africa‚Äôs sixth region, a process that began with the adoption of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union (3q) in 2003, several African nations have responded by making similar declarations, leading to the formulation, adoption and implementation of individual national diaspora policies. The original declaration by the African Union (AU) appears clear in its definition of the categories of people that constitute the African Diaspora. The apparently all-encompassing definition is meant to serve as a model for the states that make up the African Union. However, interaction with some of the national diaspora policies so far drafted and published, indicates that there is a disjunction between the affirmation of the African Union and the selective orientation of the individual African states. This paper, therefore, critically examines the various contradictions between the AU declaration and the diaspora policy orientation of selected African states. The scrutiny is done with a view to highlighting, analysing and recommending new strategies for diaspora policy formulation and revision towards the full realisation of the mutual developmental potential that the initiative of integrating the Diaspora into the institutional frameworks of African states holds.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the enthusiasm for green energy, previously contested energy and mining projects can be framed as part of a green transition. When state authorities decide to forego the standard procedural protections and the processes and forums for deliberation and local influence, it contributes to constructing green sacrifice zones. This paper compares two Swedish energy policy processes. The first is occurred during World War II and the hydropower expansion of the 1940s and 1950s. The second takes place today when wind power is expanding to increase renewable energy production. In Sweden, policymaking seems to be back to square one in the green transition, leaving out both important knowledge of the past and contemporary voices of the ongoing and probable consequences. In certain issues, such as how the recognition of the Indigenous status of the S√°mi actually affects the legislative process and how to address the Indigenous rights of the S√°mi, policymaking is particularly slow to adapt. The green transition industry is already affecting the S√°mi, as the construction of the Nordic welfare society has done during the last century, and still does. It deepens an ongoing colonial wave that started in the 1300s. By showing how the Swedish legislative process, historically as well as currently, has neglected to involve S√°mi representatives, this study points to the importance and obligation of Swedish policymaking to engage S√°mi representatives in an early phase to avoid further sacrifice zones in S√°pmi.},

We emphasize design thinking as an approach that incorporates user-centred concepts and artefacts, enabling the creation and visualization of potential futures and mediating the exploration of new perspectives and areas of intervention for innovation. However, there is limited discussion in the foresight literature on the meaningful application of design approaches. We focus on the persona method and its roles and applications in scenario building. To be meaningful in scenario building, personas need to appropriately integrate users‚Äô future needs, expectations and behaviours that shape and in turn are shaped by contexts that are yet to be realised. Based on an analysis of published case studies, the paper underscores the role of personas in fostering creative imagination, enhancing scenario engagement, and prospective sensemaking beyond their application as a storytelling vehicle in scenarios. We link persona characteristics and design to their roles in scenario building, allowing design and foresight practitioners the flexibility to tailor the persona approach to different contexts and critically assess the underlying limitations. From this, we provide recommendations for incorporating personas in scenario building and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

It includes institutions of development, research, media, and science, as well as various state actors both nationally and internationally. The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession. Each of these processes is produced and manifested both materially and epistemically. The adaptation regime is built on a vision of development in which urbanization and export-led growth are both desirable and inevitable. For the rural poor, this entails dispossession from agrarian livelihoods and outmigration. As this shift contributes to the expansion of production of export commodities such as garments and frozen shrimp, the threat of climate change and its associated migrations is reframed as an opportunity for development and growth.},

  abstract = {Liberal peacebuilding has become the target of considerable criticism. Although much of this criticism is warranted, a number of scholars and commentators have come to the opinion that liberal peacebuilding is either fundamentally destructive, or illegitimate, or both. On close analysis, however, many of these critiques appear to be exaggerated or misdirected. At a time when the future of peacebuilding is uncertain, it is important to distinguish between justified and unjustified criticisms, and to promote a more balanced debate on the meaning, shortcomings and prospects of liberal peacebuilding.},

To shed light on this question, this article investigates the ‚Äòstrategic logic‚Äô of preventive humanitarian intervention, or the assumed link between external military action and the desired outcome of preventing or stopping mass killing. It contends that there are five fundamental and seemingly irremediable tensions in this logic, all of which cast doubt on the feasibility of preventive humanitarian intervention and on the long-term prospects of R2P.},

  abstract = {Twenty-five years since foundational publications on valuing ecosystem services for human well-being1,2, addressing the global biodiversity crisis3 still implies confronting barriers to incorporating nature‚Äôs diverse values into decision-making. These barriers include powerful interests supported by current norms and legal rules~such as property rights, which determine whose values and which values of nature are acted on. A better understanding of how and why nature is (under)valued is more urgent than ever4. Notwithstanding agreements to incorporate nature‚Äôs values into actions, including the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)5 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals6, predominant environmental and development policies still prioritize a subset of values, particularly those linked to markets, and ignore other ways people relate to and benefit from nature7. Arguably, a ‚Äòvalues crisis‚Äô underpins the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss and climate change8, pandemic emergence9 and socio-environmental injustices10. On the basis of more than 50,000 scientific publications, policy documents and Indigenous and local knowledge sources, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) assessed knowledge on nature‚Äôs diverse values and valuation methods to gain insights into their role in policymaking and fuller integration into decisions7,11. Applying this evidence, combinations of values-centred approaches are proposed to improve valuation and address barriers to uptake, ultimately leveraging transformative changes towards more just (that is, fair treatment of people and nature, including inter- and intragenerational equity) and sustainable futures.},

This paper explores the intricate differences between these roles and their unique contributions to organizational success. While project managers excel in delivering projects efficiently, product managers take a holistic approach, driving the entire product lifecycle and aligning it with consumer needs and strategic goals. The transition between these roles requires a shift in mindset and the acquisition of essential skills, including market research, customer engagement, and long-term product strategy. The paper provides a roadmap for individuals embarking on this transition, emphasizing the importance of understanding organizational objectives, developing product management proficiency, conducting thorough research, assessing costs and value, and embracing the product management mindset. In an era of rapid change and innovation, navigating the path from project management to product management is not just a career transition; it's a strategic imperative for businesses aiming to thrive in the digital age.},

  abstract = {The Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has now been approving funding for adaptation projects for more than two years. Given its particular institutional status and specific focus on concrete adaptation, it is particularly relevant to study the initial experiences of it for any future upscaling of international adaptation finance, despite the fact that its own resources are getting scarce. Alternative rationales for allocating funds, based on equity and efficiency concerns at both international and subnational levels, are here tested against the criteria and priorities of the Fund and decisions made on project approval. It is concluded that equity concerns appear to be the primary motivation and that allocation is de facto made between states rather than by considering inequity between subnational communities. However, the currency of vulnerability for determining equitable outcomes in allocation decisions has not been formalized, despite its central importance to the Fund. Instead, uniform national caps have been introduced. Such an equality approach can be considered inequitable. Finally, it is noted that although the Adaptation Fund Board has continuously developed its proposal review practices and adopted a learning-by-doing approach, it should provide both a further specification of the evaluation criteria and a compilation of best practices from approved proposals, and moreover enhance the transparency of the review process, all of which would clarify its core priorities for current and future project proponents.},

We examine how the variations in the institutional arrangements related to the carbon finance aspects of projects affect the opportunities for poor rural producers involved, or those living in the vicinity of projects. Evidence is drawn from a review of three forest carbon projects in Uganda, based on qualitative stakeholder interviews and supported by policy documents and literature. Three aspects of project institutions are discussed; actors, rules and links to existing external institutions. The findings suggest that supporting such projects with carbon finance can have some positive impacts on opportunities through improved monitoring, but that considerable progress needs to be made in balancing the interests of project financers with those of the communities involved and improving policy coordination with existing institutions external to projects. We suggest that these lessons are particularly transferable to the growing number of REDD+ approaches that are strongly performance based or funded through carbon markets, and implemented through direct payment systems between buyers and local producer groups or individuals.},

But Berlin was divided by a heavily guarded concrete wall for a quarter century, with rail systems operations developing in quite different ways in East and West Berlin. Berlin‚Äôs rail system was critically evaluated before, during, and after the times of the Berlin wall, with emphasis on the postreunification period. Several valuable lessons can be learned both from Berlin‚Äôs best practices and from its less shining moments. Berlin is a particularly interesting example of rail transit redevelopment and expansion because of its repeated ‚Äúzero hour‚Äù situations after war-related destruction and after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. After 1990, extraordinary sums were invested to completely restructure Berlin‚Äôs urban and regional rail networks and to connect the city to the high-speed rail network in West Germany. In the end, postreunification Berlin‚Äôs triple challenge of simultaneously developing new high-speed connections to other cities, completely overhauling and restructuring its internal rail system, and ensuring that the new system would be properly and intermodally connected to the rest of the transportation network, is not dissimilar to the situation many U.S. cities are facing today. The core issues that warrant critical discussion are the relationships and trade-offs between the various investments into long-distance, regional, and urban rail lines.},

  abstract = {"America was once the world's dream factory. We turned imagination into reality, from curing polio to landing on the Moon to creating the internet. And we were confident that more wonders lay just over the horizon: clean and infinite energy, a cure for cancer, humanoid robots, radical life extension, and space colonies. (Also, of course, flying cars.) Science fiction would become fact. But as we moved into the late 20th century, we grew cautious, even cynical, about what the future held and our ability to shape it. America became a "Down Wing" society. Too many of us saw only the threats from rapid change. The year 2023 marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the Great Downshift in economic growth and technological progress, followed by decades of economic stagnation, downsized dreams, and a popular culture fixated on catastrophe: nuclear war, environmental collapse, plague and the zombie apocalypse. We are now at risk of another half-century of making the same Down Wing mistakes and pushing a pro-progress "Up Wing" future into the realm of impossibility. But American Enterprise Institute (AEI) economic policy expert and long-time CNBC contributor James Pethokoukis argues that there's still hope. We can absolutely turn things around-if we choose to dream and act. How dare we delay or fail to deliver for ourselves and our children. With groundbreaking ideas and sharp analysis, Pethokoukis provides a detailed roadmap to a fantastic future filled with incredible progress and prosperity that is both optimistic and realistic. The Conservative Futurist invites readers to invent the future they want to live in and fight for a better tomorrow. Through an exploration of culture, history, and economics, Pethokoukis tells the fascinating story of what went wrong in the past and what we need to do today to finally get it right. Using the latest economic research and policy analysis, as well as conversations with top economists, historians, and technologists, Pethokoukis reveals that the failed futuristic visions of the past were totally possible. And they still are. If America is to fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and launch itself into a shining tomorrow, it must again become a fully risk-taking, future-oriented Up Wing society. It's time for America to embrace the future confidently, act boldly, and take that giant leap forward."},

  abstract = {This article calls for an ethnographic and theoretical investigation of removal (and specifically, deportation) that would broaden our understanding of the significance of this purportedly routine state practice. Based on fieldwork conducted in Somaliland in 2002 and 2003, it takes as its text the narratives of a group of Somalis deported from the United States and Canada following the events of September 11, 2001. As criminal aliens, the majority of these men (and one woman) had been incarcerated both as prisoners and as administrative detainees before being deported unexpectedly to stateless Somalia. Yet, the somewhat exceptional nature of this particular deportation highlights the various political and social exclusions that might be overlooked in the more regular instances of deportation (e.g., that of illegal immigrants and rejected asylum seekers). By following the trajectories of these Muslim deportees from incarceration in the host state to reincorporation/alienation at home, it points to the legal and financial domains that underpin presentday practices of deportation and the embodied and chronotopic experiences they effect. Further, this article outlines how future anthropological work on removal might proceed while underscoring the relevance of this field to the studies of citizenship and transnationalism, globalization, and governmentality.},

Despite the growing political attention devoted to protecting victims of trafficking, I argue that in areas of Nigeria prone to economic insecurity and gender-based violence, the categories of ‚Äúvictim‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù collapse into, and begin to resemble, one another once on the ground. The need to identify and distinguish groups of migrants from one another illustrates the dilemmas that have arisen in the wake of increasingly restrictive European immigration policies. Furthermore, the return processes create a hierarchical structure in which the violence women experience in the sex industry in Europe is imagined to be worse than the everyday violence they experience at home.},

This article explores a feature of bus rapid transit within the framework of TOD‚Äôs principle of developing built environment and transit systems that trigger its citizens to shift from using private motorised vehicle to using transit system for daily mobility. This article explores Transjakarta BRT‚Äôs ability to trigger mode shift from doing other way of travelling to using Transjakarta. This article was written through a descriptive-qualitative research using inductive reasoning. Mode shift data was collected through indirect interview using online questionnaire. Other way of travelling prior to using Transjakarta was asked to Transjakarta passengers. Detailed information regarding the passengers‚Äô background and the type of trips the passengers are doing was also gathered. The data was processed using simple statistical analysis and Bartlett‚Äôs test for distribution variance. This article finds that Transjakarta is able to trigger mode shift among its passengers. Furthermore, Transjakarta is even able to trigger mode shift from using private motorised vehicle to using Transjakarta. The ability to trigger mode shift is relatively homogenous across all groups of Transjakarta passengers. This article proposes an alternate approach in evaluating a rapid transit system within the framework of TOD, that is evaluating its ability in triggering mode shift.},

But neoliberal forms of development came to undermine existing structures, thus reducing sustainability and equity. The past 20 years, though, have seen the deliberate establishment of more than 8 million new social groups across the world. This restructuring and growth of rural social capital within specific territories is leading to increased productivity of agricultural and land management systems, with particular benefits for those previously excluded. Further growth would occur with more national and regional policy support.},

  abstract = {Portland, Oregon sits at the forefront of experimenting with policies for sheltering unhoused people outside of congregate shelter. In 2021, the City Government legalized sanctioned encampments by adopting them into city land use codes and for periods throughout its housing state of emergency, it also decriminalized sleeping in public. But with the continued increase of homelessness in Portland, the city has abruptly returned to more punitive policies concerning unhoused peoples‚Äô use of space. In July 2023, the city opened its first mass encampment hosting nearly 200 people, and in July 2024, it began enforcing its ban on camping in public space. To understand this shift, the paper engages with policy mobilities and carceral geographies scholarship to examine how the City of Portland came to this about-face at this particular moment. I argue the city‚Äôs normalization of smaller tiny house encampments justified its development of mass encampments, a decision that was informed by approaches to homelessness practiced elsewhere, and one in which a significant portion of unhoused people experience more punitive conditions that partly emanate from the socio-spatial relationships in the encampment.},

Its outdated theories have permitted a world in which extreme poverty persists while the wealth of the super-rich grows year on year. And its blind spots have led to policies that are degrading the living world on a scale that threatens all of our futures. Can it be fixed? In Doughnut Economics, Oxford academic Kate Raworth identifies seven critical ways in which mainstream economics has led us astray, and sets out a roadmap for bringing humanity into a sweet spot that meets the needs of all within the means of the planet. En route, she reconstructs the character of 'rational economic man' and explains what really makes us tick. She reveals how an obsession with equilibrium has left economists helpless when facing the boom and bust of the real-world economy. She highlights the dangers of ignoring the role of energy and nature's resources -- and the far-reaching implications for economic growth when we take them into account. And in the process, she creates a new, cutting-edge economic model that is fit for the 21st century -- one in which a doughnut-shaped compass points the way to human progress. Ambitious, radical and rigorously argued, Doughnut Economics promises to reframe and redraw the future of economics for a new generation. -- Back cover},

  abstract = {The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) has succeeded in increasing its revenue by more than 22 percent in three years. This was made possible by restructuring the transportation network as part of an integrated marketing strategy. Traffic simulations demonstrated that improving frequency on the main lines could shorten travel times and attract many new customers to public transportation. In addition, lines outside the core network with little utilization were identified where service could be reduced to achieve significant cost savings with only a slight decline in the number of passengers. In 2004, new premium products, the MetroBus and MetroTram, were introduced; in 2006, their services were improved yet further. Today, the MetroBus and MetroTram run on the 26 most important lines (in addition to the subway), 24 hours a day at very short intervals. They are intensively marketed, and customers can understand the Metro network almost as well as they can the subway network. The new MetroBus and MetroTram products have achieved great success, with passenger volume on some lines rising by more than 30 percent. Overall, the BVG has gained more than 21 million new trips per year and reduced its annual operating costs by more than 9.5 million euros.},

In this paper we develop a concept of access and examine a broad set of factors that differentiate access from property. We define access as ‚Äúthe ability to derive benefits from things,‚Äù broadening from property's classical definition as ‚Äúthe right to benefit from things.‚Äù Access, following this definition, is more akin to ‚Äúa bundle of powers‚Äù than to property's notion of a ‚Äúbundle of rights.‚Äù This formulation includes a wider range of social relationships that constrain or enable benefits from resource use than property relations alone. Using this framing, we suggest a method of access analysis for identifying the constellations of means, relations, and processes that enable various actors to derive benefits from resources. Our intent is to enable scholars, planners, and policy makers to empirically ‚Äúmap‚Äù dynamic processes and relationships of access.},

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity.

In this article, we contribute to the literature on imagined futures and economies of anticipation by examining how potentially affected households navigate the state of uncertainty that is formed by threating images of displacement. The analysis highlights concerns about (non-)compensation and the vulnerability of households with insecure tenure arrangements in the context of infrastructure developments. We outline how the capacity to anticipate is a decisive factor in preparing for a future in displacement and how economies of anticipation emerge most notably around the land market. The article contributes to the concept of future-making in infrastructure studies. By presenting displacement as a multi-temporal process, we show how anticipated infrastructures have shaped and continue to shape the socio-economic developments of affected regions.},

First, I discuss his foundational work to give futures studies genuine disciplinary status through the development of critical futures studies. I explore his use of critique, his advocacy of dissent and his expansion of the methodological repertoire of the field. Second, I note his valiant attempts to emancipate foresight practice through the concept of social foresight. Richard‚Äôs vision of the routine application of foresight across society, supported by institutions of foresight and a thriving critical discipline is a compelling one. While social foresight remains a vision, Richard provided guidance on how to get there that remains highly relevant. Finally, I outline Richard‚Äôs pioneering translation of Ken Wilber‚Äôs philosophy into an integral futures practice. While there have been controversies along the way, the development of Wilberian integral futures has undoubtedly supported more comprehensive futures thinking that gives due attention to interiors as well as exteriors.},

  abstract = {En stor utfordring i dagens arealplanlegging er de mange virksomhetene som benytter seg av land- og naturressurser som konkurrerer eller kommer i konflikt med reindriftsn√¶ringen. Reindrifta deltar i et mangfold av prosesser hvor det planlegges nye inngrep og aktiviteter og hvor det skjer endringer i landskap som benyttes til reinbeite. Det er en √∏kende anerkjennelse av at tradisjons- og erfaringsbasert kunnskap m√• inkluderes i arealplanleggingen for √• oppn√• en mer helhetlig √∏kosystembasert forvaltning. Lover og regler p√• ulike niv√• forutsetter medvirkning og inkludering av reindriftsut√∏vernes kunnskap. Utbyggere legger opp til medvirkningsprosesser og avb√∏tende tiltak, mens forskere inviterer til samarbeidsprosjekter p√• tvers av disipliner, hvor reindrifta inviteres med som deltakere og informanter.    Det er likevel mye som tyder p√• at intensjonene med slike medvirkningsprosesser ikke blir tilstrekkelig fulgt opp, og at den erfaringsbaserte kunnskapen ofte blir oversett med p√•f√∏lgende konsekvenser for reindriftas livsgrunnlag og kultur. Vi vil i dette kapitlet sette s√∏kelys p√• prosessene rundt samarbeidet hvor ulike kunnskapssystemer m√∏tes og samspiller.     Artikkelen bygger p√• diskusjoner omkring reindriftas erfaringsbaserte kunnskap p√• workshopen om reindrift og arealinngrep i Troms√∏ i 2019, samt diskusjoner med reindriftsut√∏vere i Nordland gjennom flere √•r.  Problemstillinger som er l√∏ftet fram er knyttet til metodikk, verkt√∏y og retningslinjer som forskere og forvaltning tar utgangspunkt i, og betydningen av deres tiln√¶rminger for √• takle reindriftas utfordringer knyttet til √∏kt rovdyrpress, √∏kt menneskelig aktivitet i landskapet og utbygginger p√• ulike skala. I tillegg er selve prosessene rundt samarbeid og dialog ved planlagte utbygginger ansett som spesielt viktig √• sette n√¶rmere s√∏kelys p√•. Vi diskuterer denne tematikken gjennom noen konkrete eksempler fra Nordland.     En utfordring sett fra reindriftas st√•sted er manglende forst√•else for kompleksiteten i samspillet mellom reindrifta, landskapet og menneskelig aktivitet. Reindrifta peker p√• et stort behov for mer helhetlig √∏kosystemtenkning b√•de i forskning og forvaltning, hvor √∏kologiske og samfunnsmessige prosesser i mye st√∏rre utstrekning sees i sammenheng enn hva som gj√∏res i dag. Tradisjonskunnskap m√• inkluderes tidligst mulig, og allerede n√•r metodikk, retningslinjer og verkt√∏y utformes. Dette for √• oppn√• prosesser som skaper grunnlag for samarbeid og samskaping av kunnskap. Det m√• ogs√• stilles krav til utbyggere for at de skal kunne etterleve intensjonene i regelverket og reindrifta m√• ogs√• tilf√∏res ressurser for √• v√¶re i stand til √• bidra til saksbehandlingsprosessene som forutsatt.},

This shift can be attributed to the realisation that mitigation and adaptation efforts have been insufficient to avoid the impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the Paris climate conference which inscribes loss and damage as a permanent feature of the global climate regime, this paper examines the relevance of the global Loss and Damage agenda for national climate change policies. Through a structured review of the emerging policy and academic literature two primary challenges are highlighted: first, the difficulty in establishing formal attribution of loss and damage to anthropogenic climate change, and second in determining with clarity the limits to adaptation beyond which loss and damage can be described as unavoidable. In examining these two challenges, we arrive at a framework for national level policy that emphasises the underlying developmental potential of Loss and Damage. In offering this viewpoint, the narrative arc on Loss and Damage is expanded from a technical agenda towards one more attuned to existing policy and mechanisms at the local and national levels. A Comprehensive Risk Management approach is proposed as a practical framing for national and local policies to address loss and damage which could lead to addressing both the underlying and accumulating development failures and risk management capacities that shape loss and damage outcomes. This moves Loss and Damage from a reactive to a proactive responsibility and enables action now ‚Äì not only once attribution and the limits to adaptation are derived.},

The rates of deforestation have been lower than elsewhere in the tropics, and the driving forces evident in other places, government new land settlement schemes and industrialized agriculture, have largely been absent in SSA. The context and causes for African deforestation become clearer through an analysis of new, national-level data on forest cover change for SSA countries for the 2000‚Äì2005 period. The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Deforestation occurred at faster rates in nations with predominantly dry forests. The wetter Congo basin countries had lower rates of deforestation, in part because tax receipts from oil and mineral industries in this region spurred rural to urban migration, declines in agriculture and increased imports of cereals from abroad. In this respect, the Congo basin countries may be experiencing an oil and mineral fuelled forest transition. Small farmers play a more important role in African deforestation than they do in southeast Asia and Latin America, in part because small-scale agriculture remains one of the few livelihoods open to rural peoples.},

Onto this moral blank slate, critical anthropologists and political ecologists inscribe industrial/Northern blame rather than universal/pan-human blame. This article queries what our analytical stance ought to be when our field partners‚Äîthose who seem to best exemplify the inequity of climate change‚Äîdisagree with this reading of climate change. The Republic of the Marshall Islands contributes minimally to global climate change yet faces nationwide uninhabitability at its hands. Despite awareness of their tiny carbon footprint, grassroots Marshall Islanders (if not their government) have strongly favored a response of guilt and atonement rather than outrage and protest. I argue that various delegitimizing explanations of this perception‚Äîignorance, denial, performance, false consciousness‚Äîare ethnographically untenable or unsatisfying. Instead, Marshallese self-blame should be understood as the local appropriation of global warming discourse in terms of a preexisting narrative of seductive modernity and cultural decline. Such an analysis allows us to appreciate how indigenous climate change self-blame, while undoubtedly problematic in many of its implications, may also carry empowering, postcolonial, counterhegemonic potentialities that should not be discounted by those searching for radical counternarratives of climate change.},

The reasons for their downgrading point to mechanisms that are at work not only in Norway. Explanatory factors are searched for in incentives for cost-ineffective action among planners, bureaucrats and national politicians, respectively, as well as in features of the planning process and the political system. New data are used to show that the road experts‚Äô list of prioritized projects changes little after submission to the national politicians, suggesting that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration puts little emphasis on its own cost-benefit calculations. Besides, it is shown that the petroleum revenues of the state do not provide a strong reason for neglecting cost-benefit accounts. The overall contribution of the article is to offer a comprehensive explanation why professional and political authorities in Norway set road-building priorities diverging massively from those suggested by cost-benefit analysis.},

  abstract = {Like a growing a number of African countries, South Africa has embraced bus rapid transit (BRT) as a means to reform urban public transport. However, BRT services that are now operational in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Tshwane ‚Äì and under development in other cities in the country ‚Äì are confronting problems. These problems stem in part from apartheid legacies of sprawling spatial form that produce particular tidal travel patterns. Other problems are more generic including difficulties with integrating minibus-taxis into BRT networks to create greater connectivity and access at the city/metropolitan scale. Overall, these structural problems and BRT implementation issues create serious financial and equity problems for cities. We argue that, along with the pervasiveness of minibus services as the main mode of public transport, a growing recognition of these challenges is stimulating a policy-level shift in South Africa to encourage integrated public transport networks and ‚Äúhybrid systems‚Äù that focus on complementarity between scheduled services and unscheduled minibus operations, as well as innovations to improve, restructure and engage, rather than simply replace, minibus services. Indeed, some cities are working to improve minibus services or upgrade them into bus services outside of the BRT process altogether. This paper presents some findings of case study work as part of a survey of minibus-taxi innovation for the South African National Treasury and World Bank[1].Examining seven South African cities, we found five types of emerging experimentation: i) minibus operations restructuring initiatives embedded in the national Public Transport Network Grant (PTNG) framework ii) minibus operations restructuring initiatives outside the PTNG iii) minibus fleet and infrastructure improvement initiatives; iv) professional development programmes for minibus operators and their employees; and v) information and communication technology-mediated minibus improvement initiatives. Overall, we argue that this suggests a broader and potentially promising policy shift away from a reform approach centred on minibus displacement and replacement and towards a more holistic focus on integrated public transport systems with improved minibus and bus services. Key questions that then emerge include which innovations might work best and why and how they might be scaled up to have impacts on services},

  abstract = {Soil phosphorus (P) cycling in agroecosystems is highly complex, with many chemical, physical, and biological processes affecting the availability of P to plants. Traditionally, P fertilizer recommendations have been made using an insurance-based approach, which has resulted in the accumulation of P in many intensively managed agricultural soils worldwide and contributed to the widespread water quality issue of eutrophication. To mitigate further environmental degradation and because future P fertilizer supplies are threatened due to finite phosphate rock resources and associated geopolitical and quality issues, there is an immediate need to increase P use efficiency (PUE) in agroecosystems. Through cultivar selection and improved cropping system design, contemporary research suggests that sufficient crop yields could be maintained at reduced soil test P (STP) concentrations. In addition, more efficient P cycling at the field scale can be achieved through agroecosystem management that increases soil organic matter and organic P mineralization and optimizes arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) symbioses. This review paper provides a perspective on how agriculture has the potential to utilize plant and microbial traits to improve PUE at the field scale and accordingly, maintain crop yields at lower STP concentrations. It also links with the need to tighten the P cycle at the regional scale, including a discussion of P recovery and recycling technologies, with a particular focus on the use of struvite as a recycled P fertilizer. Guidance on directions for future research is provided. Core Ideas There is an urgent need to increase P use efficiency in agroecosystems. Crop yields could be maintained at lower than recommended soil test P concentrations. Both the quantity and quality of organic matter influence P availability. Further research on ability of organic P to supply P to crops is needed. Struvite has the potential to fill an important niche in P recycling.},

  abstract = {Under the threat of climate change and with disproportional impacts expected for the world‚Äôs poorest, the adaptation imperative confers renewed justification to development aid transfers, while the urgency of the problem lends itself to the uncritical application of existing solutions. Yet, an emerging body of work has raised critical questions about how adaptation is being conceived and implemented in the global South. We systematize and contribute to this critical scholarship by distinguishing three fundamental political dimensions of the adaptation problem, related to differential responsibility, the global uneven production of vulnerability, and unequal relations of power in adaptation decision-making itself. Further, based on research from across the global South, the paper suggests that the current program of ‚Äòmainstreaming‚Äô adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates an anti-politics machine, obscuring and depoliticizing rather than addressing the political dimensions of the adaptation problem. Mainstreaming risks not only reproducing development-as-usual, but in fact reinforcing technocratic patterns of control. The three-dimensional view of the politics of climate change adaptation is offered as an analytical perspective to sharpen and systematize future critical adaptation scholarship. In the conclusion, we highlight avenues toward enhanced attention to power and justice in climate change research and practice.},

As a result from the model, fixed income elasticity for the region was found to be 1.75. Fixed effect estimated separately for each country characterizes the motorization pace in the countries. Two groups of countries were detected with a significant difference in motorization paces‚ÄîSri Lanka, India, Nepal, Philippines, Pakistan, Indonesia and Thailand have motorization paces higher than the rest of the countries. Additionally, using a cross-sectional data household car and motorcycle ownerships were analyzed for three metropolitan areas characterizing South-East Asia that are Jabotabek (Indonesia), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Manila (Philippines) metropolitan areas. Results indicate that ownership of cars and motorcycles are independent of each other in Jabotabek and Manila, but negatively correlated in Kuala Lumpur; and generally, income is more influential on car ownership than motorcycle ownership.},

Their socio-cultural influence is cumulative and difficult to predict.

It quickly became clear that what was now being called ‚Äògenerative AI‚Äô would have multiple impacts and implications across the board.

They include Neoliberalism and the ‚Äòplaybook‚Äô of careless, ‚Äònon-legal‚Äô innovation that occurred during the early rise of social media platforms. The paper also critiques Silicon Valley, both for its one-sided culture and its obsession with marketing. It specifically draws attention to the characteristics and limitations of ‚Äòtechnoscientific‚Äô outlooks and the way they conceal, or edit out, key aspects of human existence. A summary of the attributes of technoscience suggests a number of possible responses. Behind these, however, is a widely ignored dilemma - the proposition that a continuation of further stages of high-tech innovation benefits the human enterprise. Yet many high-tech developments are unambiguously sociopathic. They project extreme danger and dysfunction out onto innocent people and unprepared social environments. The paper summarises recent attempts to come to terms with a radically transformed, technology saturated environment and concludes with suggestions for enhancing human agency.},

This essential volume explores intersections of imperialism and research - specifically, the ways in which imperialism is embedded in disciplines of knowledge and tradition as 'regimes of truth.' Concepts such as 'discovery' and 'claiming' are discussed and an argument presented that the decolonization of research methods will help to reclaim control over indigenous ways of knowing and being. Now in its eagerly awaited third edition, this bestselling book includes a co-written introduction and features contributions from indigenous scholars on the book's continued relevance to current research.

  abstract = {This article proposes a political economy of extraction framework that explains political order and state collapse as alternative outcomes in the face of lootable wealth. Different types of institutions of extraction can be built on lootable resources‚Äîwith divergent effects on political stability. If rulers are able to forge institutions of extraction that give them control of revenues generated by lootable resources, then these resources can contribute to political order by providing the income with which to govern. Conversely, the breakdown or absence of such institutions increases the risk of civil war by making it easier for rebels to organize. The framework is used to explain two puzzling cases that experienced sharply contrasting political trajectories in the face of lootable resources: Sierra Leone and Burma. A focus on institutions of extraction provides a stronger understanding of the wide range of political outcomes‚Äîfrom chaos, to dictatorship, to democracy‚Äîin resource-rich countries.},

  abstract = {This article explores the potential of storytelling as a method in energy futures studies, advancing creative and participatory practices to envision alternative energy visions of the future. It addresses the challenges and opportunities of using storytelling, highlighting its ability to engage diverse people, deepen our understanding of socio-technical energy systems, and centre community perspectives on energy discussions. To demonstrate this approach, I examine a storytelling game called ‚ÄúTell me an (un)fortunate story‚Äù, which was used to explore the futures of Mexico City‚Äôs municipal public markets and their energy systems, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I conclude that storytelling is a valuable tool for exploring the futures of energy systems, as it can be a playful and flexible method with unique strengths when it comes to positioning laypeople‚Äôs visions and voices at the centre. This article advances storytelling as a valuable yet underutilized mode of inquiry and contributes to the development of creative and participatory tools in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary energy futures research.},

  abstract = {The Zapatista autonomy movement in Chiapas, Mexico, is a significant example of rising social-movement resistance to neoliberalism. The neoliberal project in Latin America since the 1980s has led to a retrenchment of the state, opening new space for social movements to contest power from below. In Mexico, the weakening of corporatist and clientelist mechanisms once controlled by the party-state allowed groups like the Zapatistas to assert rights based on both collective (ethnic) identity and Mexican national citizenship. An examination of the Zapatista autonomy movement since 1994 suggests several dilemmas: (1) A territorially based model of autonomy as administrative decentralization would not fundamentally alter existing political hierarchies or the role of the state as broker for global capital. (2) Autonomy conceived as mere disengagement would leave autonomous communities cut off from resources and unprotected from the forces of the global market. (3) Autonomy defined as simply cultural pluralism falls into the neoliberal "multiculturalism trap" of atomizing communities, substituting formal "equality" for the power to establish collective identities and demand substantive rights. The Zapatistas have maneuvered around counterinsurgency and co-optation through a flexible, community-based model of autonomy, shifting in 2003 to a model of regional "Juntas de Buen Gobierno" with rotating representatives to integrate the resistance. The experiment holds lessons for other social movements in Latin America struggling to preserve grassroots decision making in opposition to the logic of global capital.},

Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries‚Äîclimate change and biosphere integrity‚Äîhave been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

Using primary data, this article examines the shifts from large-scale raiding to opportunistic theft as well as the profound transformation in the security environment over the past 10 years. We argue that the combination of a top-down sustained disarmament campaign and grassroots peace resolutions have created relative stability for the first time in decades. This stability has allowed for the expansion of markets, investments by national and international actors, and the rejuvenation of livelihoods for many residents. However, while large-scale violent cattle raids are largely a thing of the past, violence and insecurity have shifted to the domestic sphere in the form of small-scale but pervasive thefts and rampant domestic violence.},

Sivilsamfunnsorganisasjoner spiller en viktig demokratisk rolle som bindeledd mellom medborgerne og det politiske systemet. De er en arena for medborgernes deltakelse i demokratiske prosesser og en kanal hvor borgerne kan √∏ve innflytelse p√• politikken som f√∏res. Det overordnede m√•let for dette prosjektet er √• unders√∏ke hva som kjennetegner samspillet mellom frivillige organisasjoner og politiske beslutningstakere, og hvordan organisasjonene arbeider for √• oppn√• tilgang og politisk innflytelse. Denne delstudien er en casebasert unders√∏kelse av organisasjoner innenfor to felt : klima- og milj√∏feltet og velferdsfeltet. Studien er basert p√• intervjuer b√•de med sivilsamfunnsorganisasjoner og med byr√•krater og politikere / politiske r√•dgivere og en minisurvey rettet mot organisasjonene innenfor de to feltene. Gjennom dette gir vi et bilde av hvordan organisasjonene arbeider for √• oppn√• politisk innflytelse, og av hvordan mottakssiden reagerer p√• p√•virkningsfors√∏kene. I dette arbeidet stiller vi blant annet f√∏lgende sp√∏rsm√•l: Er tilgangen til beslutningstakerne bestemt av organisasjonenes ressurstilgang? Hva ser organisasjonene som suksessfaktorer i p√•virkningsarbeidet? Et viktig funn i denne rapporten, i tr√•d med dominerende teorier p√• forskningsfeltet, er sammenhengen mellom ressurssituasjon og kapasiteten for √• drive p√•virkningsarbeid i organisasjonene. De st√∏rste organisasjonene, organisasjoner som har v√¶rt i feltet en stund og besitter personellmessige og √∏konomiske ressurser, og de som har flere og ulike ressurser, har et bedre utgangspunkt enn de mindre organisasjonene. St√∏rre organisasjoner har bedre kapasitet til √• bygge opp et mer profesjonelt apparat og et st√∏rre spenn av ressurser som gir dem mulighet til √• v√¶re til stede p√• flere arenaer og med flere virkemidler i bruk. De oppfattes ogs√• som mer seri√∏se og lettere √• samarbeide med av dem som st√•r p√• mottakssiden av p√•virkningsarbeidet. Organisasjonene identifiserer flere avgj√∏rende faktorer for √• lykkes i p√•virkningsarbeidet, som omfatter menneskelige ressurser, godt grunnarbeid, arbeid over tid, sakseierskap, samarbeid og alliansebygging.},

Forced to cancel its eleventh round of funding due to a shortfall in donor pledges, the Fund is currently in firefighting mode, overhauling its leadership, governance structures, and operations. Drawing on a case study of Uganda, we look at how the original Global Fund vision to be a simple financial instrument has played out at the country level. Even prior to the cancellation of round 11, the proliferation of partners required to sustain the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria experiment led to increasing bureaucratization and an undermining of the Fund‚Äôs own intentions to award life-saving grants according to need. Understanding these effects through the ethnographic material presented here may be one way of reflecting on the Fund‚Äôs structure and practices as it struggles to reinvent itself in the face of criticism that it has impeded resource distribution.},

  abstract = {This article provides an environmental and institutional history of the highly politicized and contested process of setting a Net Present Value (NPV) for forests in India, in a context of increasing conflicts over land for development, conservation and indigenous rights. Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to ‚Äúsave‚Äù forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.},

Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4\%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin.

  abstract = {NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE ECONOMIST   "The most important book on decision making since Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow."--Jason Zweig, The Wall Street Journal  Everyone would benefit from seeing further into the future, whether buying stocks, crafting policy, launching a new product, or simply planning the week's meals. Unfortunately, people tend to be terrible forecasters. As Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed in a landmark 2005 study, even experts' predictions are only slightly better than chance. However, an important and underreported conclusion of that study was that some experts do have real foresight, and Tetlock has spent the past decade trying to figure out why. What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught?  In Superforecasting, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people--including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer--who set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They've beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They've even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are "superforecasters."  In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Weaving together stories of forecasting successes (the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound) and failures (the Bay of Pigs) and interviews with a range of high-level decision makers, from David Petraeus to Robert Rubin, they show that good forecasting doesn't require powerful computers or arcane methods. It involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course.  Superforecasting offers the first demonstrably effective way to improve our ability to predict the future--whether in business, finance, politics, international affairs, or daily life--and is destined to become a modern classic.},

  abstract = {On August 28, 2003, the Commissioners of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (PTRC) submitted their Final Report to President Alejandro Toledo and the nation, thus joining the growing list of countries that have implemented truth commissions as a means of transitioning from a period of armed conflict and authoritarian rule towards the founding of a procedural democracy. The PTRC shared several features with the Guatemalan and South African commissions that preceded it. All three commissions were considered ‚Äúgender sensitive‚Äù because they actively sought out women's experiences of violence. This focus reflected the desire to write more ‚Äúinclusive truths,‚Äù as well as changes in international jurisprudence. In this paper, the author draws upon research she has conducted since 1995 in Peru to explore the commissioning of truth and some implications in terms of women and war. She examines what constitutes ‚Äúgender sensitive‚Äù research strategies, as well as the ways in which truth commissions have incorporated these strategies into their work. Truth and memory are indeed gendered, but not in any common-sensical way. Thus the author hopes to offer a more nuanced understanding of the gendered dimensions of war.},

For more than a millennium, Polynesians have occupied the remotest islands in the Pacific Ocean, a vast triangle stretching from Hawaii to New Zealand to Easter Island. Until the arrival of European explorers they were the only people to have ever lived there. Both the most closely related and the most widely dispersed people in the world before the era of mass migration, Polynesians can trace their roots to a group of epic voyagers who ventured out into the unknown in one of the greatest adventures in human history. How did the earliest Polynesians find and colonize these far-flung islands? How did a people without writing or metal tools conquer the largest ocean in the world? This conundrum, which came to be known as the Problem of Polynesian Origins, emerged in the eighteenth century as one of the great geographical mysteries of mankind. For Christina Thompson, this mystery is personal: her Maori husband and their sons descend directly from these ancient navigators. In Sea People, Thompson explores the fascinating story of these ancestors, as well as those of the many sailors, linguists, archaeologists, folklorists, biologists, and geographers who have puzzled over this history for three hundred years. A masterful mix of history, geography, anthropology, and the science of navigation, Sea People combines the thrill of exploration with the drama of discovery in a vivid tour of one of the most captivating regions in the world." --Amazon.com},

  abstract = {The biocultural richness of Mexico is among the highest worldwide. A history of over 7000 years of agriculture, and a persistent tradition of peasant social resistance movements that climaxed during the agrarian revolution in the early 20th century, continued in the indigenous resistance in Chiapas leading to the Zapatista uprising in 1992, and continues to be expressed in present local and regional confrontations for the defense of territory. Scholars agree that agroecology conceptually includes ecological and agricultural scientific research activity, empirical practices applied for agriculture, and the nuclear goal of numerous rural social movements. What has not been sufficiently established is how these three spheres of agroecology interact with each other and what emergent synergies they generate. Taking as an example the production in Mexico of three key agricultural goods‚Äîmaize, coffee, and honey‚Äîour paper briefly reviews the existing relations between knowledge generation, agroecological practices, and rural social processes. We conclude by reflecting on the role of agroecological research in the context of an agrarian sustainability committed to helping reduce social inequity, marginality, and exploitation, as much as reverting the severe deterioration of the natural environment: both common issues in contemporary Mexico.},

To achieve a sustainable transition - built on inclusion, equity, and protection of nature and human rights - these challenges need to be handled in integration. This report is based on a review of existing research and knowledge. It focuses both on how climate change impacts societies, individuals, and current land use, and on a set of climate change mitigation solutions that potentially conflict with other land-use interests. The report highlights different ways in which the low-carbon transition leaves a clear footprint on, and under the ground. For example, through renewable energy production, privatised areas for forest carbon storage, and mineral extraction. A main goal of the report is to provide knowledge for public authorities and development-cooperation agencies on how to reduce negative effects of climate change, facilitate rapid transitions to low-carbon societies, while simultaneously avoiding policies and measures that may challenge human rights or have a negative impact on the attainment of other sustainability goals.},

This article contributes to the emerging scholarship on climate litigation by exploring whether, how and with what effects such litigation interacts with the UNFCCC negotiations. For this purpose, the article contextualizes normative claims about the influence of climate court cases through practice-embedded views of stakeholders in the loss and damage context and provides a typology of loss and damage-related cases. Having due regard to the fact that litigation for liability and compensation of climate harms is still at an early stage, it argues that this legal avenue offers significant potential to advance the UNFCCC negotiations on loss and damage, and provides recommendations on how both spheres can be more strongly interlinked.},

Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to ‚Äúdecolonize our schools,‚Äù or use ‚Äúdecolonizing methods,‚Äù or, ‚Äúdecolonize student thinking‚Äù, turns decolonization into a metaphor.

Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, nonwhite, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or ‚Äúsettler moves to innocence‚Äù, that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In this article, we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward ‚Äúan ethic of incommensurability‚Äù that recognizes what is distinct and what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to unsettling themes within transnational/Third World decolonizations, abolition, and critical spaceplace pedagogies, which challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful potential alliances.},

  abstract = {Incentive-based mechanisms are regarded as efficient instruments to reconcile conservation and development. This win‚Äìwin objective has been difficult to accomplish; cross-compliance has, therefore, been suggested as a mechanism to ensure sustainability. Cross-compliance, which requires producers to conform to production regulations and environmental standards to qualify for direct payments, has been a popular instrument in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Since 1990, cross-compliance has been the main characteristic of policy design in Sami reindeer husbandry in Finnmark, Norway. All direct transfers to the Sami pastoralists have been connected to harvesting demands to decrease the number of reindeer and to conserve pastures. The content of these incentive-based mechanisms are decided through negotiated agreements with the Sami Reindeer Herders‚Äô Association of Norway (NRL), and the regulation of reindeer numbers and access to pastures are delegated to co-management boards. Despite the participation of the Sami pastoralists in shaping these policies, win‚Äìwin objectives have not been achieved. Although the cross-compliance program could have been improved by payment for graded results, the lack of regulations by the administration or co-management boards is more likely to be the cause of failure to reach sustainability. Despite the long-term failures of the cross-compliance program, policies have been slow to change. We might attribute this delay to the NRL‚Äôs strong position in the negotiated agreements. In general, we argue that the success of the cross-compliance program depends on a well-functioning governance system that can implement regulations and sanctions if incentives do not work as intended.},

  abstract = {The co-creation of knowledge is gaining recognition and use within the science, practice, and movement of agroecology. Knowledge co-creation fosters participatory learning and development, which differs from passive knowledge sharing. This approach can bridge the real and perceived gaps across diverse forms of knowledge, including what is often distinguished as farmers‚Äô traditional, Indigenous, tacit, or local knowledge and experts‚Äô scientific, western, or generalizable knowledge. Formal academic documentation of processes and outcomes related to knowledge co-creation is limited; therefore, we bring in examples of published research, drawing from fields of agroecology, participatory action research, and science and technology studies, along with a firsthand farmer perspective on co-creation. Combined, these frameworks offer insight into the potential benefits of knowledge co-creation in agroecology. Many of these challenges, such as navigating power dynamics, may be addressed through mindful research and community practices, including strong communication and transparent expectations and goals. Co-creation processes have traditionally and continually taken place between farmers and throughout communities without academic acknowledgment and/or interpretation of such. We reinstate the invaluable role of farmer-centered inquiry, understanding, and application, which offer benefits to individual farmers and their extended communities of practice and research, in addition to holding spiritual and cultural significance. The co-creation of knowledge in agroecology presents a compelling, adaptive approach and outcome for the increasingly complex challenges facing farmers and the agrifood system.},

  abstract = {Discussions about the role of reparations in helping societies recover from civil conflict are divided between those who believe that reparations should focus on rights recognition and those who think reparations have the potential to foster economic development. This debate is particularly salient in Colombia, where the scale and duration of civil conflict resulted in a large number of victims to be repaired. I argue that the Colombian government treats reparations‚Äîthat is, cash payments to victims of human rights violations‚Äîas seed money that, if properly tended, will grow into a reconstructed life for the victim. Using interviews, ethnographic observations and textual data, I argue that: 1) those in charge of implementing the reparation policy followed the script of micro-finance development interventions; 2) this policy aims to create a new post-conflict subjectivity that I name the ‚Äúresponsible victim‚Äù; and, 3) beneficiaries perform the ‚Äúresponsible victim‚Äù in ambivalent ways, embracing the narrative of self-reliant citizens while also requesting more attention and aid from the state. In so doing, I highlight how the use of reparations as development shifts the focus from acknowledging past-wrongdoings to an emphasis on a prosperous post-conflict economic future},

The adoption in 2013 of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) puzzled observers, because key state parties, such as the United States, had historically opposed the policy. This article examines the roles of frame contestation and ambiguity in accounting for the evolution and institutionalization of the ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù norm within the UNFCCC. The article applies frame analysis to the data from coverage of the negotiations and elite interviews. It reveals that two competing framings, one focused on liability and compensation and the other on risk and insurance, evolved into a single, overarching master frame. This more ambiguous framing allowed parties to attach different meanings to the policy that led to the resolution of differences among the parties and the embedding of the idea of loss and damage in international climate policy.},

WPE has important consequences for ecosystem functioning, global carbon balances and human economies. Here we report, using high-resolution satellite imagery, that woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8\% over the past three decades and that a diversity of drivers, other than CO2, were able to explain 78\% of the spatial variation in this trend. A decline in burned area along with warmer, wetter climates drove WPE, although this has been~mitigated in areas with high population growth rates, and high and low extremes of herbivory, specifically browsers. These results confirm global greening trends, thereby bringing into question widely held theories about declining terrestrial carbon balances and desert expansion. Importantly, while global drivers such as climate and CO2 may enhance the risk of WPE, managing fire and herbivory at the local scale provides tools to mitigate continental WPE.},

The paper argues that such projects must be assessed in a broad perspective that includes both operational, tactical and strategic aspects, and unintended as well as intended effects. A generic six-criteria evaluation framework is suggested, inspired by a framework frequently used to evaluate development assistance projects. It is tested on 20 Norwegian projects from various sectors (transport, defence, ICT, buildings). The results indicate that the majority of projects were successful, especially in operational terms, possibly because they underwent external quality assurance up-front. It is argued that applying this type of standardized framework provides a good basis for comparison and learning across sectors. It is suggested that evaluations should be conducted with the aim of promoting accountability, building knowledge about infrastructure projects, and continuously improve the tools, methods and governance arrangements used in the front-end of project development.},

  abstract = {From a nonideal justice perspective, this article investigates liability and compensation in their wider theoretical context to better understand the governance of climate loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The usual rationale for considering compensation takes a backward-looking understanding of responsibility. It links those causing harm directly to its remedy. This article shows that, under current political circumstances, it is more reasonable to understand responsibility as a forward-looking concept and thus to differentiate responsibilities on grounds of capacity and solidarity. The article argues that loss and damage entitlements in UNFCCC governance should be understood as entitlements to a threshold of capabilities for resilience. While compensation merely means redressing the situation ex ante a threat, entitlements to capabilities for resilience can entail more demanding responsibilities of support. This means that Article 8 of the Paris Agreement has much more demanding implications than it might at first appear.},

  abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been successfully used for treating various wastewaters for decades and have been identified as a sustainable wastewater management option worldwide. However, the application of CW for wastewater treatment in frigid climate presents special challenges. Wetland treatment of wastewater relies largely on biological processes, and reliable treatment is often a function of climate conditions. To date, the rate of adoption of wetland technology for wastewater treatment in cold regions has been slow and there are relatively few published reports on CW applications in cold climate. This paper therefore highlights the practice and applications of treatment wetlands in cold climate. A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of contaminant removal in different wetland systems including: (1) free water surface (FWS) CWs; (2) subsurface flow (SSF) CWs; and (3) hybrid wetland systems, is presented. The emphasis of this review is also placed on the influence of cold weather conditions on the removal efficacies of different contaminants. The strategies of wetland design and operation for performance intensification, such as the presence of plant, operational mode, effluent recirculation, artificial aeration and in-series design, which are crucial to achieve the sustainable treatment performance in cold climate, are also discussed. This study is conducive to further research for the understanding of CW design and treatment performance in cold climate.},

  abstract = {Social media offers users an online platform to freely express themselves; however, when users post opinionated and offensive comments that target certain individuals or communities, this could instigate animosity towards them. Widespread condemnation of obesity (fatness) has led to much fat stigmatizing content being posted online. A methodological framework that uses a novel mixed-method approach for unearthing hate speech patterns from large text-based corpora gathered from social media is proposed. We explain the use of computer-mediated quantitative methods comprising natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis, emotion analysis and topic modelling, along with qualitative discourse analysis. Next, we have applied the framework to a corpus of texts on gendered and weight-based data that have been extracted from Twitter and Reddit. This assisted in the detection of different emotions being expressed, the composition of word frequency patterns and the broader fat-based themes underpinning the hateful content posted online. The framework has provided a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative methods that draw on social science and data mining techniques to build real-world knowledge in hate speech detection. Current information systems research is limited in its use of mixed analytic approaches for studying hate speech in social media. Our study therefore contributes to future research by establishing a roadmap for conducting mixed-method analyses for better comprehension and understanding of hate speech patterns.},

What is less heavily researched is the concept of ‚Äúinvulnerability,‚Äù an idea that feminist and decolonial theory has many tools to critique. After unpacking the material and discursive elements of vulnerability politics, this article focuses on invulnerability as a concept that is an influential yet unexplored set of masculine and colonial fantasies. These fantasies ‚Äì of modernity, mastery, and continentalism ‚Äì are critiqued through different critical traditions, which are brought into conversation with climate politics literature. I then discuss the counternarratives of Oceanic thought, following Teresia Teaiwa‚Äôs prompt to ‚Äúisland the world.‚Äù I argue that this can be done through a focus on care, relationality, and a decolonial politics of resistance. I conclude that resisting the politics of vulnerability requires an engagement with critical feminist and decolonial thought to enable an imaginative piercing of the fantasies of invulnerability.},

  abstract = {There is consensus that the global food system is not delivering good nutrition for all and is causing environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, such that a profound transformation is needed to meet the challenges of persistent malnutrition and rural poverty, aggravated by the growing consequences of climate change. Agroecological approaches have gained prominence in scientific, agricultural and political discourse in recent years, suggesting pathways to transform agricultural and food systems that address these issues. Here we present an extensive literature review of concepts, definitions and principles of agroecology, and their historical evolution, considering the three manifestations of agroecology as a science, a set of practices and a social movement; and relate them to the recent dialogue establishing a set of ten iconic elements of agroecology that have emerged from a global multi-stakeholder consultation and synthesis process. Based on this, a consolidated list of principles is developed and discussed in the context of presenting transition pathways to more sustainable food systems. The major outcomes of this paper are as follows. (1) Definition of 13 consolidated agroecological principles: recycling; input reduction; soil health; animal health; biodiversity; synergy; economic diversification; co-creation of knowledge; social values and diets; fairness; connectivity; land and natural resource governance; participation. (2) Confirmation that these principles are well aligned and complementary to the 10 elements of agroecology developed by FAO but articulate requirements of soil and animal health more explicitly and distinguish between biodiversity and economic diversification. (3) Clarification that application of these generic principles can generate diverse pathways for incremental and transformational change towards more sustainable farming and food systems. (4) Identification of four key entry points associated with the elements: diversity; circular and solidarity economy; co-creation and sharing of knowledge; and, responsible governance to enable plausible pathways of transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems.},

Settler colonialism is ecological domination, committing environmental injustice against Indigenous peoples and other groups. Focusing on the context of Indigenous peoples‚Äô facing US domination, this article investigates philosophically one dimension of how settler colonialism commits environmental injustice. When examined ecologically, settler colonialism works strategically to undermine Indigenous peoples‚Äô social resilience as self determining collectives. To understand the relationships connecting settler colonialism, environmental injustice, and violence, the article first engages Anishinaabe intellectual traditions to describe an Indigenous conception of social resilience called collective continuance. One way in which settler colonial violence commits environmental injustice is through strategically undermining Indigenous collective continuance. At least two kinds of environmental injustices demonstrate such violence: vicious sedimentation and insidious loops. The article seeks to contribute to knowledge of how anti-Indigenous settler colonialism and environmental injustice are connected.},

  abstract = {It may be too late to achieve environmental justice for some indigenous peoples, and other groups, in terms of avoiding dangerous climate change. People in the indigenous climate justice movement agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate change. However, the qualities of relationships connecting indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the process of responding to climate change. The required qualities include, among others, consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity. Indigenous traditions of climate change view the very topic of climate change as connected to these qualities, which are sometimes referred to as kin relationships. The entwinement of colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization failed to affirm or establish these qualities or kinship relationships across societies. While qualities like consent or reciprocity may be critical for taking coordinated action urgently and justly, they require a long time to establish or repair. A relational tipping point, in a certain respect, has already been crossed, before the ecological tipping point. The time it takes to address the passage of this relational tipping point may be too slow to generate the coordinated action to halt certain dangers related to climate change. While no possibilities for better futures should be left unconsidered, it's critical to center environmental justice in any analysis of whether it's too late to stop dangerous climate change.

  abstract = {In many of the world's growing cities, semi-formal buses form the basis of public transit systems. However, little open and standardized data exist on these systems. The Digital Matatus project in Nairobi, Kenya set out to test whether the geo-locative capabilities of mobile technology could be used to collect data on a semi-formal transit system and whether that data could be translated into the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data standard for wider use. The results of this work show that mobile technologies, particularly mobile phones, which are increasingly prevalent in developing countries, can indeed be used effectively to collect and deliver data in a modified GTFS format for semi-formal transit. Perhaps more importantly, through our work in Nairobi, we were able to identify the benefits and technical needs for developing data on semi-formal transit. Overall, the work illustrates (1) how the GTFS can be adapted to semi-formal systems and used by other cities with such transit systems, (2) that there is demand from technologists as well as transport communities for comprehensive data on semi-formal transit, (3) that releasing the data openly in the GTFS standard format can help to encourage the development of transportation applications, and (4) that including the entire transit community during the data development can create a community of users and mechanisms for institutionalizing a process of data updating and sharing. The engagement strategies our research team developed around the data collection process in Nairobi became just as important as the resulting data it produced.},

  abstract = {Communities around the world are already enduring both direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic climate change, leading to questions about accountability. Over the past decade, the scientific, legal, and policy communities have grown increasingly concerned with the question of accountability for the social losses and damages (L\&D) stemming from climate change, evidenced by the development of the scientific attribution research field, legal cases against fossil fuel companies, and negotiations for L\&D continuing at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As these sectors converge, however, there are some serious conceptual, and related ethical, issues regarding accountability and attribution including which communities are included in attribution studies and lawsuits, which emitters are considered in policy and law, and whether and how finance transfer is included. This article reviews the dominant spheres of L\&D studies and mechanisms and explore what an ‚Äúaccountability-based approach‚Äù rooted in theories of climate justice has to bear on the broader conversation. Here, some of the challenges are explored in determining accountability and finance transfer, including potential pitfalls which may inadvertently lead to injustices in such an approach. Finally, a process for operationalizing the accountability-based approach is presented, which may help circumvent some of the challenges.},

  abstract = {Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just as advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and climatic processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs underpin a range of ecosystem goods and services that contribute to the well-being of millions of people. However, tropical coral reefs in the Anthropocene are likely to be functionally different from reefs in the past. In this perspective piece, we ask, what does the Anthropocene mean for the provision of ecosystem services from coral reefs? First, we provide examples of the provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services underpinned by coral reef ecosystems. We conclude that coral reef ecosystem service research has lagged behind multidisciplinary advances in broader ecosystem services science, such as an explicit recognition that interactions between social and ecological systems underpin ecosystem services. Second, drawing on tools from functional ecology, we outline how these social‚Äìecological relationships can be incorporated into a mechanistic understanding of service provision and how this might be used to anticipate future changes in coral reef ecosystem services. Finally, we explore the emergence of novel reef ecosystem services, for example from tropicalized coastlines, or through changing technological connections to coral reefs. Indeed, when services are conceived as coming from social‚Äìecological system dynamics, novelty in services can emerge from elements of the interactions between people and the ecosystem. This synthesis of the coral reef ecosystem services literature suggests the field is poorly prepared to understand the changing service provision anticipated in the Anthropocene. A new research agenda is needed that better connects reef functional ecology to ecosystem service provision. This research agenda should embrace more holistic approaches to ecosystem service research, recognizing them as co-produced by ecosystems and society. Importantly, the likelihood of novel ecosystem service configurations requires further conceptualization and empirical assessment. As with current ecosystem services, the loss or gain of services will not affect all people equally and must be understood in the context in which they occur. With the uncertainty surrounding the future of coral reefs in the Anthropocene, research exploring how the benefits to people change will be of great importance.

This paper examines the process for development of the first performance-based competency standard for project portfolio management and identifies how this contributes to the body of knowledge in both project portfolio management and project management more broadly. The intent is to use the Standard to improve project portfolio management capability and practice in organisations, which in turn promotes efficient resource use and more profitable project outcomes.

Extant research revolves around the binary construct of challenger-versus-supporter, ignoring the nature and scope of challenges that China poses to liberal peace. Also, these studies tend to unidimensionally examine China‚Äôs stance on particular elements of liberal peace. There is scant research assessing China‚Äôs role against the overall normative structure of the liberal peace paradigm. This article proposes a typology of contestation that targets different constitutive parts of liberal peace. China‚Äôs stances on these constitutive parts are scrutinised based on a systematic review of its policy documents and interviews with scholars and practitioners in Beijing, Shanghai, Geneva and New York. This article finds that China has generally abstained from contesting the normative basis of liberal peace (validity contestation). However, it has been actively pursuing content contestation by reshaping the sequencing of existing elements of liberal peace and by incorporating the democratisation of the international system into the peacebuilding agenda. Moreover, China clearly opposes externally formulated or imposed peace solutions, whereby it advances application contestation against liberal peace.},

  abstract = {Within academic discourses of postcolonial theory, much has been written on whether and how Marxism can be drawn on to understand the ‚Äòpostcolonial world‚Äô and, in this regard, what the relations between Eurocentrism and Marxism are. In practice, Marxism remains a core analytical framework for many emancipatory movements from the Global South, as is the case for Egyptian organisation of Revolutionary Socialists, whose popularity grew during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The following paper is based on anthropological research with Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists in exile and the political underground. It showcases that many academic postcolonial debates sideline the agency of Marxist social actors from the Global South, their theoretical and practical endeavours, and their own modes of knowledge production. It is through the agency of Revolutionary Socialist social actors that Marxism travels from below, is translated, (re)read, debated, and materialises itself in given contexts. I highlight how Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists utilise Marxism as a living theory in their contemporary political practice and argue that their practice in exile as fellow travellers can be understood as a reconfiguration of the concept of travelling theory into travelling theory from below. Herein the centrality of social actors‚Äô practice in grasping theory manifests itself.},
