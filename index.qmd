Climate adaptation shapes up to be the defining paradigm of the 21th century. This thesis seeks to understand the role climate adaptation plays today, and how it will shape the future. This will investigate this through a mixed-methods approach. 

First, it analyzes data from the OECD's Creditor Reporting System to see how North-South finance flows have changed over the last ten years. It finds that while the amount of aid tagged as climate adaptation is rising, it is not evenly dispersed across the board. This leads to a structural shift in aid, where a larger part of aid is out in construction, transport and energy. 

Second, it analyzes the National Adaptation Plans submitted to the UNFCCC, through a Structured Topic Model. It finds that, despite the planned interventions amount to a total rewiring of the economy on all levels, they focus on the need for economic growth through infrastructure development. There are clear differences in climate adaptaiton flows
