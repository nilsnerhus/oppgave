Climate adaptation has emerged as a central mechanism for addressing climate injustice, with wealthy nations pledging hundreds of billions in support for vulnerable countries. This thesis examines whether adaptation planning enables climate justice or reproduces colonial relations through new vocabularies. Through computational analysis of 45 National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC, I reveal troubling patterns of epistemological homogenization that contradict adaptation's stated aims.

Using structural topic modeling and a novel Dominance Index to measure discourse centralization, the analysis uncovers three key findings. First, despite facing radically different climate impacts, countries show remarkable convergence in how they conceptualize adaptation, with 32% of corpus-level discourse concentrated on financial mechanisms and institutional procedures. Second, this convergence is shaped more by regional institutional networks (explaining 20.1% of variance) than by actual climate vulnerabilities (explaining only 1.8%). Third, the patterns reflect the movement of consultants and frameworks that impose singular approaches across diverse contexts.

Drawing on critical theory, particularly concepts of epistemicide and post-development, I argue that adaptation planning operates as an "anti-politics machine" that transforms questions of justice into technical problems. Rather than enabling diverse responses based on local knowledge, the adaptation regime eliminates alternative epistemologies while appearing to provide assistance. This represents what the title captures as a "COP-out"â€”allowing Northern countries to avoid fundamental economic transformation while reshaping Southern societies through planning requirements.

The findings suggest that genuine climate justice requires not reformed adaptation planning but recognition of the autonomous strategies communities have always used to navigate environmental change. Until adaptation enables rather than eliminates epistemological diversity, it will remain a mechanism for maintaining rather than transforming the relations that produce vulnerability.
