Climate adaptation has become central to North-South relations, with billions of dollars flowing from developed to developing countries to support adaptation planning. Yet despite facing radically different climate challenges—from sea-level rise to desertification to glacial melt—countries produce remarkably similar National Adaptation Plans. This thesis investigates what this convergence reveals about how adaptation planning operates and whose interests it serves.

Using structural topic modeling to analyze all 45 National Adaptation Plans submitted to the UNFCCC, I develop the "Dominance Index"—a novel measure of discourse centralization that quantifies how concentrated adaptation discourse is around particular themes. The analysis reveals extraordinarily high centralization across all contexts, with dominance values ranging from 59.9% to 98.0% above baseline distributions.

Three key patterns emerge. First, universal concentration occurs despite diverse environmental challenges, suggesting systematic institutional constraints rather than climate-responsive planning. Second, procedural topics—institutional arrangements, financial mechanisms, planning processes—dominate discourse regardless of actual vulnerabilities, accounting for approximately 40% of all content. Third, p-value patterns reveal that higher-income countries enjoy greater discourse autonomy while lower-income countries show stronger institutional capture, providing statistical evidence that financial dependence shapes planning homogenization.

These findings provide empirical validation for critical theories about adaptation as contemporary colonialism. Drawing on Boaventura de Sousa Santos's concept of "epistemicide," I argue that adaptation planning systematically eliminates alternative knowledge systems while appearing to support vulnerable countries. Rather than enabling diverse responses to environmental change, the adaptation regime transforms political questions about climate justice into technical problems of resource allocation and capacity building.

The thesis contributes both methodologically—through computational tools that make visible the operation of power in governance processes—and theoretically, by demonstrating how climate governance continues colonial relations through new vocabularies. The findings suggest that genuine climate justice requires not better adaptation planning but recognition of the multiple worlds that exist beyond adaptation frameworks.
