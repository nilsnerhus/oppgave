Climate adaptation has become central to North-South relations, with billions of dollars promised from developed to developing countries to support adaptation planning. Yet despite facing radically different climate challenges from sea-level rise to desertification to glacial melt countries produce remarkably similar National Adaptation Plans. This thesis investigates what this convergence reveals about how adaptation planning operates and whose interests it serves.

Using structural topic modeling to analyze all English language National Adaptation Plans submitted to the UNFCCC, I develop the "Dominance Index"â€”a new way to measure that quantifies how concentrated adaptation discourse is around particular themes. The analysis reveals extraordinarily high centralization across all contexts,

Three key patterns emerge. First, universal concentration occurs despite diverse environmental challenges, suggesting systematic institutional constraints rather than climate-responsive planning. Second, procedural topics, institutional arrangements, financial mechanisms, planning processes, dominate discourse regardless of category, with over half of the discourse. Third, p-value patterns reveal that higher-income countries enjoy greater discourse autonomy while lower-income countries show stronger institutional capture, providing statistical evidence that financial dependence shapes planning homogenization.

These findings provide empirical validation for critical theories about adaptation as contemporary colonialism. Drawing on the concept of "epistemicide," I argue that adaptation planning as it is practiced eliminates alternative knowledge systems in the quest to support vulnerable countries. Rather than enabling diverse responses to environmental change, the adaptation regime transforms political questions about climate justice into technical problems of resource allocation and capacity building.

The thesis contributes both methodologically, through computational tools that make the operation of power in governance processes quantifiable, and theoretically, by demonstrating how climate governance continues colonial relations through new vocabularies. The findings suggest that genuine climate justice requires not better adaptation planning but recognition of the multiple worlds that exist beyond adaptation frameworks.
