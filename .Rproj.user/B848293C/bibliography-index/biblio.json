            "abstract": "There has always been a critical, emancipatory tradition within futures studies. Although those voices can still be heard, there has been a growing tendency for futures studies to be driven by more utilitarian needs in business and government. Whilst it is positive that futures thinking and research is increasingly valued within corporate and policy-making settings, much of that work appears to lack genuine plurality of worldviews and interests. The paper traces the changing contexts for futures research over the past 25 years. It argues that futures research needs to be viewed as part of the re-politicisation – in the Habermasian sense – of technocratic decision-making. It suggests that there are three particular reasons for revisiting the need for criticality in futures research: the increasing acknowledgement of systemic interrelatedness (ecological, social, economic), a growth in the forward-looking socio-economic paradigm that permeates both business and policy, and the challenge of theory development. Drawing on social theory and futures research, we suggest three pathways for revived critical futures research: socio-technical practices, future-oriented dialectics, and socio-economic imaginaries. As a result, the paper calls for development in futures studies that would dialectically integrate and overcome the dichotomy between instrumentalisation and (critical) theorising that can be currently understood as somewhat antagonistic. In order to find a balance between these antagonistic dimensions, futures research should be more engaged in enabling critique and revealing assumptions and interests.",

            "abstract": "Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to support sustainable and resilient urban planning. However, design and planning urban NBS targeted at the needs of the local context require knowledge about the causal relationships between NBS, ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC) This paper aims at contributing to this knowledge, by systematically identifying nexuses (i.e. qualitative links) between UC, ES and NBS, and describing plausible causal relationships. A conceptual UC-ES-NBS criteria framework was built, and used to guide a two-step systematic literature review on current UC and on the supply of ES by urban NBS. This was followed by a non-systematic literature review, which complemented the previous one by unveiling knowledge gaps on the biophysical and social processes and attributes on which specific ES classes depend. The non-systematic review was also used to identify additional NBS. The UC review identified 18 UC and 58 sub-challenges, and illustrated which UC were more studied, according to the type of literature and environmental and socio-economic attributes of urban contexts. The ES review led to the development of an urban NBS classification, and supported the identification of UC-ES and ES-NBS nexuses, which were analysed and classified into four groups of causal relationship. For the nexuses identified as direct plausible causal relationship, the main processes and attributes on which the supply of specific ES depend were pointed out. Relationships between UC, ES, NBS, processes, and attributes were represented in the form of network diagrams. Our results can be used to support urban policies aimed at mainstreaming NBS and as a basis to further understand UC-ES-NBS relationships.",

            "abstract": "The growing scale and intensity of climate change poses a substantial challenge to the status quo of society and politics. Adapting to the risks associated with extreme weather events and changing climatic conditions will require the re-imagination of many aspects of politics and society. Therefore, climate change can be framed as a problem of imagination; one in which our relationship to the future is central to understanding how possibilities in the present are perceived. This research analyses public submissions made on New Zealand’s first draft National Adaptation Plan to understand how future climate adaptation is framed and imagined by different groups. In analysing submissions we identify and describe four thematic “adaptive futures” that each argue for varied amounts of socio-political change from the status quo: data driven resilience; growth and opportunity; nature-society change; and flaxroots transformation. Underpinning these adaptive futures are emerging advocacy coalitions that seek to shape what is seen as possible, imaginatively, politically and materially. Our analysis also highlights how risks and opportunities are perceived by whom, and insights into attempts to delineate the boundaries of adaptive imagination and political possibility.

            "abstract": "This article examines whether the use of climate change as a “spice” in order to attract donor funding may instead exacerbate existing environmental problems. The World Bank’s latest adaptation project in coastal Bangladesh aims to create higher and wider embankments against rising sea levels. This disregards a long history of how embankments, by stopping beneficial monsoon inundations, result in dying rivers and damaging floods that devastate rural livelihoods. Bangladeshi “development brokers” must therefore balance their roles as project employees supporting embankments as adaptation, and as locals knowledgeable about their harmful effects. The article shows how donors, NGOs, consultants and government bodies with different agendas, priorities and knowledge backgrounds “translate” climate change to legitimise their activities. It contributes to debates about the politics of environmental knowledge production by arguing that development brokerage helps explain why some climate adaptation projects increase environmental vulnerability, while others address local needs.",

            "abstract": "Environmental peacebuilding represents a paradigm shift from a nexus of environmental scarcity to one of environmental peace. It rests on the assumption that the biophysical environment?s inherent characteristics can act as incentives for cooperation and peace, rather than violence and competition. Based on this, environmental peacebuilding presents cooperation as a win-win solution and escape from the zero-sum logic of conflict. However, there is a lack of coherent environmental peacebuilding framework and evidence corroborating the existence of this environment-peace nexus. Building on a multidisciplinary literature review, this article examines the evolution of environmental peacebuilding into an emerging framework. It unpacks the concept and explains its main building blocks (conditions, mechanisms and outcomes) to develop our understanding of when, how and why environmental cooperation can serve as a peacebuilding tool. It assembles these building blocks into three generic trajectories (technical, restorative and sustainable environmental peacebuilding), each characterised according to their own causality, drivers and prerequisites, and illustrated with concrete examples. Finally, this article draws attention to the remaining theoretical gaps in the environmental peacebuilding literature, and lays the foundations for an environmental peacebuilding research agenda that clarifies if and how environmental cooperation can spill over across borders, sectors and scales towards sustainable peace.",

            "abstract": "The coastal Isthmus of Tehuantepec region of Oaxaca, Mexico –known locally as the Istmo – is regarded as one of the best wind energy generating sites in the world. Marketed as a preeminent solution to mitigating climate change, wind energy is now applying increasing pressure on indigenous groups in the region. The article begins by outlining a definition of colonialism that assists in identifying the temporal continuity of the colonial project to understand its relationship with wind energy development. The next section briefly reviews colonial genocide studies, discussing disciplinary debates between liberal and postliberal genocide scholars, the relevance of self-management within colonial systems, the genocide-ecocide nexus and the “intent” of destructive development projects. This leads into reviewing the claims and findings that emerged from fieldwork in the Istmo, which is divided into the north and south to show the different, yet similar dynamics taking place in the region. Finally, the article concludes that wind energy development as a “solution” to climate change not only distracts from its dependence on fossil fuels and mining, but renews and continues a slow industrial genocide, assimilating and targeting (indigenous) people who continue to value their land, sea and cultural relationships.",

As such, the main body comprises a series of case studies of adaptation projects from some of the poorest regions of the world, placed between an introduction and conclusion that seek to clarify the meaning of adaptation and draw lessons for practitioners and policy makers. More specifically, this introduction has three objectives. The first is to locate the focus of this book - community-based adaptation - in the broader context of ongoing development challenges and the international climate change negotiations. This is the purpose of the following two sections. The second objective is to develop a framework for understanding adaptation. This is the task of the middle five sections, in which attention is drawn to the importance of uncertainty in climate predictions, the role of vulnerability in adaptation, and the components of adaptive capacity and resilience. The importance of an appreciation of the role played by culture in adaptation interventions is also highlighted. The concepts presented in these sections are illustrated with examples from the case study chapters that follow and are drawn together to offer a coherent approach to understanding adaptation. Third and finally, the last section provides an overview of the chapters that make up the remainder of the book.",

            "abstract": "\"Originally published in Spanish in 2017, Pluriversal Politics theorizes what is possible and real and how our conceptualizations of these notions at different moments in time determine our political practices at both the individual and collective levels. For Arturo Escobar, realities are plural and always in the making, and this manner of theorizing the world has profound political implications for imagining liberation and a world otherwise. The chapters, which were originally written as essays, point towards diverse ontologies- or modes of being in the world -and ultimately offer tools for thinking about what to do in our current planetary crisis, one driven by predatory global capitalism. Escobar moves us toward a pluriversal worldview, or a world where many worlds fit, and gestures at how we can find evidence of these possibilities in social movements, particularly Afro-Colombian and indigenous movements from Colombia. These indigenous movement leaders in Colombia problematize ontologies in defense of their territories, worlds, and modes of existing thereby destabilizing notions of the real and the possible. Most of the essays were originally written in Spanish between 2014 and 2017, and presented in contexts ranging from academic presentations to activist gatherings. Chapter 1 explores diverse examples of the real and the possible, such as those found in ancestral traditions and in other societies as well as those theorized by academics in attempts to destabilize the real. Chapter 2 proposes ways of thinking from the bottom and with the Earth, inspired by the revolutionary Mexican Zapatistas. In chapter 3 Escobar presents a discourse analysis of a statement by the Nasa people of the Northern Cauca region of Colombia to argue for the adoption of a Mother Earth Liberation concept/movement. Chapters 4 and 5, respectively, explore epistemologies of the South and autonomous social theory productions from Latin America. Chapter 6 considers the idea of \"living beyond development\" and examines relevant experiences in the resistance to development that provide a glimpse into other worlds while chapter 7 considers a radical sustainability strategy for Colombia given the current planetary crisis. Finally, chapter 8 imagines a different design for the ecologically devasted city of Cali, Colombia, a new design grounded in self-organization and the relationality of life. This book will be of interested to students and scholars in anthropology, social theory, and Latin American studies\"–",

            "abstract": "This article discusses three interrelated notions: civilizational crisis, transitions to the pluriverse, and radical interdependence, or relationality, as an ontological and political foundation for transitions. After introducing the indigenous notion of “terricide” and discussing Sylvia Wynter’s argument about the need to challenge the dominant view of the human as liberal, secular, Western and bourgeois, the article outlines the ontological perspective of relationality as a reemerging understanding of the fundament of Life that sharply differs from the dominant dualistic ontology of the modern West. The second part of the article proposes six axes for transition strategies: the re-communalization of social life; the re-localization of social, economic, and cultural activities; the strengthening of local autonomies; the de-patriarchalization and de-racialization of social relations; the re-integration with the Earth; and the construction of meshworks among transformative alternatives.",

The essays collected in this special section are both responses to our invitation and provocations in their own right. From our point of view, they each take Critical Future Studies forward and collectively augur well for the further development of this field. This introductory essay contains three sections. First, we briefly situate Critical Future Studies within an intellectual and historical context. In the following section we discuss some relevant scholarship published very recently in cognate fields (specifically Anticipation Studies and Sociology) and which are pertinent to Critical Future Studies as a developing field of study. In the final section, we introduce the articles contained in this this special section: six diverse contributions on topics including green capitalism, artificial intelligence and automation, science fiction, post-scarcity societies and the future of work, and socialist futures.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces the interdisciplinary field of Critical Future Studies (CFS). CFS investigates the scope and constraints within public culture for imagining and debating different potential futures. It interrogates imagined futures founded – often surreptitiously – upon values and assumptions from the past and present, as well as those representing a departure from current social trajectories. CFS draws on perspectives from various disciplines including sociology, political studies, intellectual history, cultural history, media and cultural studies, utopian studies, science and technology studies, and philosophy. CFS also engages with discourses and ideas from the natural sciences (including popular science), computing and economics. And, given our concern with public culture, CFS aims to contribute constructively to vigorous and imaginative public debate about the future – a futural public sphere – and to challenge a prevalent contemporary cynicism about our capacity to imagine alternative futures while trapped in a parlous present. To that extent, we propose CFS as a programme of engaged and open-ended social critique, not as a solely academic endeavour. Our paper begins by describing the relationship between CFS and mainstream Future Studies. Subsequently, we discuss the contemporary context for Critical Future Studies. Here we make the case that CFS is a timely and even urgent project at our current historical juncture, arguing also for the significance of both utopian and dystopian imaginings. We then go on to discuss methodologies within CFS scholarship. Finally, we conclude by reflecting on the values underpinning CFS. Overall, this paper not only describes CFS as a field of research but also serves as an invitation to cultural scholars to consider how their own work might intersect with and contribute to CFS.",

            "abstract": "Questions about the future, and futurelessness, have attracted wide-ranging attention in recent years. Our article explores what Sociology offers. We reflect on the apparent contradiction that the future was bracketed off from the discipline in its early history, yet also offers rich theoretical, methodological and empirical resources for futures research. We demonstrate this through an analysis of the contributions to this Special Issue, each of which draws on explicitly Sociological theories and methods to consider futures in a range of fields. Finally, we explore further developments necessary for a Sociology of the Future. We argue that Sociology can and should be more directly involved in claiming what futures might be, should be and in materialising these claims. This means moving beyond Sociology – as a distinct set of resources – towards expansive engagement with other future-making actors. This may challenge and change Sociology but may also be key to its future.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has moved from a strong focus on mitigation to increasingly address adaptation. Climate change is no longer simply about reducing emissions, but also about enabling countries to deal with its impacts. Yet, most studies of the climate regime have focused on the evolution of mitigation governance and overlooked the increasing number of adaptation-related decisions and initiatives. In this article, we identify the body of rules and commitments on adaptation and suggest that there are more attempts to govern adaptation than many mitigation-focused accounts of the international climate regime would suggest. We then ask: to what degree are adaptation rules and commitments legalized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change? We examine the degree of precision and obligation of relevant decisions through an extensive analysis of primary United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change documents, secondary literature on adaptation initiatives and institutions, interviews with climate change experts and negotiators, and participant observation at climate negotiations. Our analysis finds that adaptation governance is low in precision and obligation. We suggest that this is partly because adaptation is a contested global public good and because ?package deals? are made with mitigation commitments. This article makes a vital contribution to the global environmental politics literature given that adaptation governance is under-studied and poorly understood. It also contributes to the legalization literature by highlighting how contested global public goods may be governed globally, but with low obligation and precision.",

            "abstract": "This chapter provides readers with a comprehensive reference to futures studies methods and their practical use by introducing a new typology based on the common questions people ask when exploring their anticipatory imagination. While the typology does not cover all futures methods, it serves as a helpful tool for academic scholars and practitioners new to the field. It aims to guide readers in identifying suitable methods for their specific questions, activities, and contexts. It begins by summarizing existing classifications of futures studies methods found in academic literature, publicly available foresight toolkits, and other practice-oriented sources, and then presents its own typology based on when to use specific methods to address particular questions. The chapter proposes this typology instead of a taxonomy, as futures work requires adaptability and flexibility. The proposed typology also distinguishes between modality and method, addressing the challenge of classifying purely futures methods versus research approaches used in other disciplines. The chapter then discusses creating new and emerging methods, decolonizing methods, and strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. It also explores emerging approaches for evaluating futures studies and foresight research. The concluding section provides a summary of the chapter’s approach and offers suggestions for further refinement and codification of methods in futures studies and foresight.",

While many planners and futurists might locate themselves in separate discursive spaces, from the perspective developed in this article the similarities in their epistemic basis are more similar than different. Thus, the focus of this effort is on planning and futures studies generally; and specifically, the various perspectives on how the future is planned for: namely, the predictive-empirical, the cultural—interpretative, and the critical—post-structural are articulated.",

It utility is not in predicting the future but in creating transformative spaces for the creation of alternative futures.

The challenge is to conduct research that moves up and down these layers of analysis and thus is inclusive of different ways of knowing.",

            "abstract": "The pursuit of adaptation to climate change, both theoretically and practically, has intensified considerably over the past decade in response to increasing awareness of the potential impacts of global climate change. Despite this momentum, the interaction of climate change adaptation with pre-existing strategies to reduce vulnerability and build resilience in the developing world has only recently received significant attention. Using the example of disaster risk reduction, this paper explores the developing interface between climate change adaptation and existing development methodologies that have overlapping interests. While it has been established that there must be greater collaboration between these fields, many questions remain surrounding the scope of such interaction. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and then explores some unanswered questions and developing conceptualizations. An examination of the theoretical points of convergence and divergence raises a range of questions surrounding how climate change adaptation is conceptualized in both the academic literature and the policy environment. There is a rich space to consider pre-existing development pathways within the adaptation narrative. Enhancing adaptive capacity requires robust frameworks that more holistically engage the embedded structures that perpetuate both socio-economic and environmental vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation to climate change is being planned and implemented across the developing world. As billions of development aid dollars are being mobilised around this new theme there are risks that adaptation efforts of the development sector will result in familiar problems. In this paper we draw upon postdevelopment perspectives that critically consider development aid and the role of the development sector to scrutinise emerging approaches to adaptation. We suggest that a postdevelopment approach to adaptation contributes a much-needed analysis of the agendas that are shaping adaptation discourses and helps us to see nascent possibilities for adaptation that are already unfolding in diverse localities.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystems provide essential services that form the basis of human well-being. Climate change-induced losses and damages to ecosystem services (l&d-ES) thus have significant impacts on societies. Yet, little of the work on losses and damages (l&d) has focused on ecosystem services. Also in international climate negotiations, where the debate emerged with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), there remains space for better understanding and addressing l&d-ES. Part of the explanation of this lies in the challenge of assessing such l&d. To address this gap, this paper reviews scientific literature and data obtained from Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNAs) to explore ways forward for more in depth assessments. The review confirms that little attention has been given to the topic, identifying 27 relevant scientific papers with only 6 providing a disaggregated monetary value for l&d-ES. Also amongst the 64 analyised PDNAs, only 12 report such disaggregated value; valuing just one ecosystem service per impacted ecosystem. The review finds that the majority of both the scientific literature and the PDNAs relies on extrapolating values from the literature. To enhance l&d-ES assessment and, with that, the opportunity for better understanding, recognition and uptake by e.g. the WIM, this paper makes three recommendations: 1. establishing a baseline of ecosystems recognized for their services of disaster risk reduction and/or climate change adaptation, while highlighting the need for an accessible and representative benefit transfer database; 2. enhancing collaboration between scientists and practitioners; and 3. quantitatively increasing data on l&d-ES.Key policy insights There remains space for better understanding and addressing l&d-ES.To facilitate assessing l&d-ES, the establishment of ecological baselines should be encouraged for ecosystem services that can be reported on in other circumstances.Additionally, a benefit transfer database is needed that is that is geographically and ecologically representative, explicitly oriented towards l&d-ES, and easily accessible to both researchers and decision-makers.Considering the divergence of ecosystems addressed by different stakeholders, it may be advisable to encourage the collaboration of a wide stakeholder range, including scientists, to collect data that advance the understanding of l&d-ES.Disaggregated assessment of l&d-ES should be quantitatively increased and the WIM could encourage the reporting of l&d-ES, in order to expand the database and understanding of l&d-ES.",

Both static and interactive graphics are described and the use of color, shape, shading, grouping, annotation, and animations are covered in detail.

In the context of globalization, this path-breaking book has shown that what we think of as war is becoming an anachronism. In its place is a new type of organized violence or ’new wars’—a mixture of war, organized crime, and massive violations of human rights.This new edition has been fully revised and updated, and includes an afterword answering the critics of the New Wars argument. A new chapter shows how old war thinking in Afghanistan and Iraq greatly exacerbated what turned out to be, in many ways, archetypal new wars—characterized by identity politics, a criminalized war economy, and civilians as the main victims. The third edition of New and Old Wars will be essential reading for students of international relations, politics, and conflict studies, as well as to all those interested in the changing nature and prospect of warfare.",

            "abstract": "In honor of its 50th anniversary, the World Futures Studies Federation (WFSF) held its XXV World Conference in Paris. The conference provided a venue for reviewing earlier developments and reevaluating prospective directions in the futures field. Scientific-based futures studies has a long history, drawing from a variety of fields including sociology, policy sciences, philosophy of science, economic prognostics, and environmental sustainability. Futures studies became widely acknowledged as an academic discipline in the 1960s when it became evident in the global scientific community. The 1970s saw a focus on global challenges and discussions about preferred futures. The synthesis of futures studies emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, with critical and evolutionary approaches contributing to the advancement of theoretical foundations. The twenty-first century focuses on anticipation and futures literacy, the development of post-normal, metamodern, and integral approaches, and the attainment of foresight in common practice. Future research is expected to focus on various aspects, including artificial general intelligence (AGI), socio-technical transitions, singularity, sustainability, societal collapses, entrepreneurial innovation, energy futures, decolonization, negation and post-prefix notions, systemic foresight, applied foresight, and on-site foresight. Future research activities are expected to also include research objects, policy challenges, and problems that do not yet exist.",

It explores theoretical approaches to green finance, with Marxist perspectives on shifting capital-nature relations in broader regimes of capitalist accumulation that are complemented with a Foucauldian lens on biopolitical governmentality. It then examines specific forms of green financial markets and instruments, with financial geographers focusing most strongly on carbon markets, green bonds and catastrophe bonds/insurance-linked securities and the reconfiguration of risks. The final section covers governance and regulation of green finance through a growing assemblage of organisations and programmes, and the evolving roles of state actors and central banks in just climate transition.",

It is argued in this article that the analytical movements of generalization, specification, abstraction, and concretization can make us more conscious of what our work might be a case, and that the same data have the potential to make different cases depending on these analytical movements. An analytical matrix is developed, and the four movements and various pitfalls are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that climate change is leading to irreversible and existential impacts on vulnerable communities and countries across the globe. Among other effects, this has given rise to public debate and engagement around notions of climate crisis and emergency. The Loss and Damage (L&D) policy debate has emphasized these aspects over the last three decades. Yet, despite institutionalization through an article on L&D by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the Paris Agreement, the debate has remained vague, particularly with reference to its remit and relationship to adaptation policy and practice. Research has recently made important strides forward in terms of developing a science perspective on L&D. This article reviews insights derived from recent publications by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others, and presents the implications for science and policy. Emerging evidence on hard and soft adaptation limits in certain systems, sectors and regions holds the potential to further build momentum for climate policy to live up to the Paris ambition of stringent emission reductions and to increase efforts to support the most vulnerable. L&D policy may want to consider actions to extend soft adaptation limits and spur transformational, that is, nonstandard risk management and adaptation, so that limits are not breached. Financial, technical, and legal support would be appropriate for instances where hard limits are transgressed. Research is well positioned to further develop robust evidence on critical and relevant risks at scale in the most vulnerable countries and communities, as well as options to reduce barriers and limits to adaptation.",

The hardest part of research isn’t answering a question. It’s knowing what to do before you know what your question is. Where Research Begins tackles the two challenges every researcher faces with every new project: How do I find a compelling problem to investigate—one that truly matters to me, deeply and personally? How do I then design my research project so that the results will matter to anyone else? This book will help you start your new research project the right way for you with a series of simple yet ingenious exercises. Written in a conversational style and packed with real-world examples, this easy-to-follow workbook offers an engaging guide to finding research inspiration within yourself, and in the broader world of ideas. Read this book if you (or your students): have difficulty choosing a research topic know your topic, but are unsure how to turn it into a research project feel intimidated by or unqualified to do research worry that you’re asking the wrong questions about your research topic have plenty of good ideas, but aren’t sure which one to commit to feel like your research topic was imposed by someone else want to learn new ways to think about how to do research. Under the expert guidance of award-winning researchers Thomas S. Mullaney and Christopher Rea, you will find yourself on the path to a compelling and meaningful research project, one that matters to you—and the world.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation to climate change is about planning for the future while responding to current pressures and challenges. Adaptation scientists are increasingly using future visioning exercises embedded in co-production and co-development techniques to assist stakeholders in imagining futures in a changing climate. Even if these exercises are growing in popularity, surprisingly little scrutiny has been placed on understanding the fundamental assumptions and choices in scenario approaches, timeframes, scales, or methods, and whether they result in meaningful changes in how adaptation is being thought about. Here, we unpack key insights and experiences across 62 case studies that specifically report on using future visioning exercises to engage stakeholders in climate change adaptation. We focus on three key areas: 1) Stakeholder diversity and scales; 2) Tools, methods, and data, and 3) Practical constraints, enablers, and outcomes. Our results show that most studies focus on the regional scale (n = 32; 52%), involve mainly formal decision makers and employ vast array of different methods, tools, and data. Interestingly, most exercises adopt either predictive (what will happen) and explorative (what could happen) scenarios while only a fraction use the more normative (what should happen) scenarios that could enable more transformative thinking. Reported positive outcomes include demonstrated increases in climate change literacy and support for climate change adaptation planning. Unintended and unexpected outcomes include increased anxiety in cases where introduced timeframes go beyond an individual’s expected life span and decreased perceived necessity for undertaking adaptation at all. Key agreed factors that underpin co-production and equal representation, such as gender, age, and diversity, are not well reported, and most case studies do not use reflective processes to harness participant feedback that could enable more robust methodology development. This is a missed opportunity in developing a more fundamental understanding of how these exercises can effectively shift individual and collective mindsets and advance the inclusion of different viewpoints as a pathway for more equitable and just climate adaptation.",

            "abstract": "This paper contributes to integrating human-centred design approaches in foresight. We emphasize design thinking as an approach that incorporates user-centred concepts and artefacts, enabling the creation and visualization of potential futures and mediating the exploration of new perspectives and areas of intervention for innovation. However, there is limited discussion in the foresight literature on the meaningful application of design approaches. We focus on the persona method and its roles and applications in scenario building. To be meaningful in scenario building, personas need to appropriately integrate users’ future needs, expectations and behaviours that shape and in turn are shaped by contexts that are yet to be realised. Based on an analysis of published case studies, the paper underscores the role of personas in fostering creative imagination, enhancing scenario engagement, and prospective sensemaking beyond their application as a storytelling vehicle in scenarios. We link persona characteristics and design to their roles in scenario building, allowing design and foresight practitioners the flexibility to tailor the persona approach to different contexts and critically assess the underlying limitations. From this, we provide recommendations for incorporating personas in scenario building and conclude with suggestions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Development in Bangladesh is increasingly defined by and through an adaptation regime, a socially and historically specific configuration of power that governs the landscape of possible intervention in the face of climate change. It includes institutions of development, research, media, and science, as well as various state actors both nationally and internationally. The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession. Each of these processes is produced and manifested both materially and epistemically. The adaptation regime is built on a vision of development in which urbanization and export-led growth are both desirable and inevitable. For the rural poor, this entails dispossession from agrarian livelihoods and outmigration. As this shift contributes to the expansion of production of export commodities such as garments and frozen shrimp, the threat of climate change and its associated migrations is reframed as an opportunity for development and growth.",

            "abstract": "The Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has now been approving funding for adaptation projects for more than two years. Given its particular institutional status and specific focus on concrete adaptation, it is particularly relevant to study the initial experiences of it for any future upscaling of international adaptation finance, despite the fact that its own resources are getting scarce. Alternative rationales for allocating funds, based on equity and efficiency concerns at both international and subnational levels, are here tested against the criteria and priorities of the Fund and decisions made on project approval. It is concluded that equity concerns appear to be the primary motivation and that allocation is de facto made between states rather than by considering inequity between subnational communities. However, the currency of vulnerability for determining equitable outcomes in allocation decisions has not been formalized, despite its central importance to the Fund. Instead, uniform national caps have been introduced. Such an equality approach can be considered inequitable. Finally, it is noted that although the Adaptation Fund Board has continuously developed its proposal review practices and adopted a learning-by-doing approach, it should provide both a further specification of the evaluation criteria and a compilation of best practices from approved proposals, and moreover enhance the transparency of the review process, all of which would clarify its core priorities for current and future project proponents.",

            "abstract": "With momentum building around the implementation of REDD+ programmes and projects, questions surrounding the appropriate structuring of institutions are becoming increasingly important. We examine how the variations in the institutional arrangements related to the carbon finance aspects of projects affect the opportunities for poor rural producers involved, or those living in the vicinity of projects. Evidence is drawn from a review of three forest carbon projects in Uganda, based on qualitative stakeholder interviews and supported by policy documents and literature. Three aspects of project institutions are discussed; actors, rules and links to existing external institutions. The findings suggest that supporting such projects with carbon finance can have some positive impacts on opportunities through improved monitoring, but that considerable progress needs to be made in balancing the interests of project financers with those of the communities involved and improving policy coordination with existing institutions external to projects. We suggest that these lessons are particularly transferable to the growing number of REDD+ approaches that are strongly performance based or funded through carbon markets, and implemented through direct payment systems between buyers and local producer groups or individuals.",

            "abstract": "At COP27, the Kenyan and UK governments signed a climate finance agreement to accelerate the implementation of the High Grand Falls mega-dam on Tana River. Communities living near the dam site have been anticipating the dam construction since the post-independence era. The plans have been revived in the context of Kenya’s Vision 2030. In this article, we contribute to the literature on imagined futures and economies of anticipation by examining how potentially affected households navigate the state of uncertainty that is formed by threating images of displacement. The analysis highlights concerns about (non-)compensation and the vulnerability of households with insecure tenure arrangements in the context of infrastructure developments. We outline how the capacity to anticipate is a decisive factor in preparing for a future in displacement and how economies of anticipation emerge most notably around the land market. The article contributes to the concept of future-making in infrastructure studies. By presenting displacement as a multi-temporal process, we show how anticipated infrastructures have shaped and continue to shape the socio-economic developments of affected regions.",

            "abstract": "This short commentary explores Richard Slaughter’s foresight practice – his strategies and methods for approaching futures thinking and futures doing. I concentrate on three areas where Richard has made significant strategic and methodological innovations that have carried the futures field forward. First, I discuss his foundational work to give futures studies genuine disciplinary status through the development of critical futures studies. I explore his use of critique, his advocacy of dissent and his expansion of the methodological repertoire of the field. Second, I note his valiant attempts to emancipate foresight practice through the concept of social foresight. Richard’s vision of the routine application of foresight across society, supported by institutions of foresight and a thriving critical discipline is a compelling one. While social foresight remains a vision, Richard provided guidance on how to get there that remains highly relevant. Finally, I outline Richard’s pioneering translation of Ken Wilber’s philosophy into an integral futures practice. While there have been controversies along the way, the development of Wilberian integral futures has undoubtedly supported more comprehensive futures thinking that gives due attention to interiors as well as exteriors.",

Over the past two decades, the global climate change regime has shifted from a focus primarily on mitigation, to both mitigation and adaptation and finally to the current era in which loss and damage has emerged as a key fixture on the agenda with the establishment of the Warsaw international mechanism on loss and damage at the 19th Conference of the Parties in November 2013. This shift can be attributed to the realisation that mitigation and adaptation efforts have been insufficient to avoid the impacts of climate change.",

            "abstract": "In the wake of the Paris climate conference which inscribes loss and damage as a permanent feature of the global climate regime, this paper examines the relevance of the global Loss and Damage agenda for national climate change policies. Through a structured review of the emerging policy and academic literature two primary challenges are highlighted: first, the difficulty in establishing formal attribution of loss and damage to anthropogenic climate change, and second in determining with clarity the limits to adaptation beyond which loss and damage can be described as unavoidable. In examining these two challenges, we arrive at a framework for national level policy that emphasises the underlying developmental potential of Loss and Damage. In offering this viewpoint, the narrative arc on Loss and Damage is expanded from a technical agenda towards one more attuned to existing policy and mechanisms at the local and national levels. A Comprehensive Risk Management approach is proposed as a practical framing for national and local policies to address loss and damage which could lead to addressing both the underlying and accumulating development failures and risk management capacities that shape loss and damage outcomes. This moves Loss and Damage from a reactive to a proactive responsibility and enables action now – not only once attribution and the limits to adaptation are derived.",

            "abstract": "Under the threat of climate change and with disproportional impacts expected for the world’s poorest, the adaptation imperative confers renewed justification to development aid transfers, while the urgency of the problem lends itself to the uncritical application of existing solutions. Yet, an emerging body of work has raised critical questions about how adaptation is being conceived and implemented in the global South. We systematize and contribute to this critical scholarship by distinguishing three fundamental political dimensions of the adaptation problem, related to differential responsibility, the global uneven production of vulnerability, and unequal relations of power in adaptation decision-making itself. Further, based on research from across the global South, the paper suggests that the current program of “mainstreaming” adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates an anti-politics machine, obscuring and depoliticizing rather than addressing the political dimensions of the adaptation problem. Mainstreaming risks not only reproducing development-as-usual, but in fact reinforcing technocratic patterns of control. The three-dimensional view of the politics of climate change adaptation is offered as an analytical perspective to sharpen and systematize future critical adaptation scholarship. In the conclusion, we highlight avenues toward enhanced attention to power and justice in climate change research and practice.",

It brings together three unlikely fields of knowledge: the practice field of community development, the organizational context of bureaucracy and the futures methodology known as Causal Layered Analysis (CLA). The paper begins by explaining CLA and then providing an overview of the field of community development within the organizational context of bureaucracy. It briefly describes the research process and then outlines findings at each layer of analysis. The paper concludes by reflecting upon the usefulness of CLA as a means of responding to dilemmas within the current practice of community development.",

            "abstract": "The launch of ChatGPT created a tidal wave of interest, rapid uptake of the app and a surge of capital investment. It quickly became clear that what was now being called “generative AI” would have multiple impacts and implications across the board. The paper begins by outlining aspects of the context from which these innovations arose. They include Neoliberalism and the “playbook” of careless, “non-legal” innovation that occurred during the early rise of social media platforms. The paper also critiques Silicon Valley, both for its one-sided culture and its obsession with marketing. It specifically draws attention to the characteristics and limitations of “technoscientific” outlooks and the way they conceal, or edit out, key aspects of human existence. A summary of the attributes of technoscience suggests a number of possible responses. Behind these, however, is a widely ignored dilemma - the proposition that a continuation of further stages of high-tech innovation benefits the human enterprise. Yet many high-tech developments are unambiguously sociopathic. They project extreme danger and dysfunction out onto innocent people and unprepared social environments. The paper summarises recent attempts to come to terms with a radically transformed, technology saturated environment and concludes with suggestions for enhancing human agency.",

This article contributes to the emerging scholarship on climate litigation by exploring whether, how and with what effects such litigation interacts with the UNFCCC negotiations. For this purpose, the article contextualizes normative claims about the influence of climate court cases through practice-embedded views of stakeholders in the loss and damage context and provides a typology of loss and damage-related cases. Having due regard to the fact that litigation for liability and compensation of climate harms is still at an early stage, it argues that this legal avenue offers significant potential to advance the UNFCCC negotiations on loss and damage, and provides recommendations on how both spheres can be more strongly interlinked.",

            "abstract": "How does an idea emerge and gain traction in the international arena when its underpinning principles are contested by powerful players? The adoption in 2013 of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) puzzled observers, because key state parties, such as the United States, had historically opposed the policy. This article examines the roles of frame contestation and ambiguity in accounting for the evolution and institutionalization of the “loss and damage” norm within the UNFCCC. The article applies frame analysis to the data from coverage of the negotiations and elite interviews. It reveals that two competing framings, one focused on liability and compensation and the other on risk and insurance, evolved into a single, overarching master frame. This more ambiguous framing allowed parties to attach different meanings to the policy that led to the resolution of differences among the parties and the embedding of the idea of loss and damage in international climate policy.",

            "abstract": "From a nonideal justice perspective, this article investigates liability and compensation in their wider theoretical context to better understand the governance of climate loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The usual rationale for considering compensation takes a backward-looking understanding of responsibility. It links those causing harm directly to its remedy. This article shows that, under current political circumstances, it is more reasonable to understand responsibility as a forward-looking concept and thus to differentiate responsibilities on grounds of capacity and solidarity. The article argues that loss and damage entitlements in UNFCCC governance should be understood as entitlements to a threshold of capabilities for resilience. While compensation merely means redressing the situation ex ante a threat, entitlements to capabilities for resilience can entail more demanding responsibilities of support. This means that Article 8 of the Paris Agreement has much more demanding implications than it might at first appear.",

What is less heavily researched is the concept of “invulnerability,” an idea that feminist and decolonial theory has many tools to critique. After unpacking the material and discursive elements of vulnerability politics, this article focuses on invulnerability as a concept that is an influential yet unexplored set of masculine and colonial fantasies. These fantasies – of modernity, mastery, and continentalism – are critiqued through different critical traditions, which are brought into conversation with climate politics literature. I then discuss the counternarratives of Oceanic thought, following Teresia Teaiwa’s prompt to “island the world.” I argue that this can be done through a focus on care, relationality, and a decolonial politics of resistance. I conclude that resisting the politics of vulnerability requires an engagement with critical feminist and decolonial thought to enable an imaginative piercing of the fantasies of invulnerability.",

            "abstract": "There is consensus that the global food system is not delivering good nutrition for all and is causing environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, such that a profound transformation is needed to meet the challenges of persistent malnutrition and rural poverty, aggravated by the growing consequences of climate change. Agroecological approaches have gained prominence in scientific, agricultural and political discourse in recent years, suggesting pathways to transform agricultural and food systems that address these issues. Here we present an extensive literature review of concepts, definitions and principles of agroecology, and their historical evolution, considering the three manifestations of agroecology as a science, a set of practices and a social movement; and relate them to the recent dialogue establishing a set of ten iconic elements of agroecology that have emerged from a global multi-stakeholder consultation and synthesis process. Based on this, a consolidated list of principles is developed and discussed in the context of presenting transition pathways to more sustainable food systems. The major outcomes of this paper are as follows. (1) Definition of 13 consolidated agroecological principles: recycling; input reduction; soil health; animal health; biodiversity; synergy; economic diversification; co-creation of knowledge; social values and diets; fairness; connectivity; land and natural resource governance; participation. (2) Confirmation that these principles are well aligned and complementary to the 10 elements of agroecology developed by FAO but articulate requirements of soil and animal health more explicitly and distinguish between biodiversity and economic diversification. (3) Clarification that application of these generic principles can generate diverse pathways for incremental and transformational change towards more sustainable farming and food systems. (4) Identification of four key entry points associated with the elements: diversity; circular and solidarity economy; co-creation and sharing of knowledge; and, responsible governance to enable plausible pathways of transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems.",

            "abstract": "Communities around the world are already enduring both direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic climate change, leading to questions about accountability. Over the past decade, the scientific, legal, and policy communities have grown increasingly concerned with the question of accountability for the social losses and damages (L&D) stemming from climate change, evidenced by the development of the scientific attribution research field, legal cases against fossil fuel companies, and negotiations for L&D continuing at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As these sectors converge, however, there are some serious conceptual, and related ethical, issues regarding accountability and attribution including which communities are included in attribution studies and lawsuits, which emitters are considered in policy and law, and whether and how finance transfer is included. This article reviews the dominant spheres of L&D studies and mechanisms and explore what an “accountability-based approach” rooted in theories of climate justice has to bear on the broader conversation. Here, some of the challenges are explored in determining accountability and finance transfer, including potential pitfalls which may inadvertently lead to injustices in such an approach. Finally, a process for operationalizing the accountability-based approach is presented, which may help circumvent some of the challenges.",
