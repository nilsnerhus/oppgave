# Methods {#sec-methods}

In this section, I explain the methods I will use to find data and to analyze it. 

First, I advocate for the mixed-methods design as a way of getting a better picture of climate adaptation, and explain the focus on the study on reports and reported uses of funds. 

Second, I will explain the OECD CRS dataset, and how I modelled it. 

Third, I will explain the climate adaptation plans, how I analyzed them and why I focussed on the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). 

Last, I will explain how I built the scenarios, based on the Causal Layered analysis. 

## Mixed-methods design

By looking at the reported data on climate adaptation from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective, this thesis gets a closer understanding of how climate adaptation is conceptualized and used in North-South relations. This also avoids the risk of getting a one-sided understanding of the issue. 

Most importantly, despite the added complexity to the analysis and dissimination, is that the quantitative part makes it possible to get a starting point and establish how climate adaptation has changed over the last 25 years and what it is today. This makes the insights from the qualitative part much more fruitful, as the visions of the future are deeply influenced by actions and ideas today. This increases the relevance of the study, and is best practice. 

The mixed methods also makes it possible to combine the views of the donors (the ODA) with the views of the recipients (the NAPs), and compare how they are similar or differ. 

## Reports (and plans) as the focus of the study 

By comparing the stated preferences of the donor-countries (as part of the UNFCCC) and comparing them to actual spending and plans, I can get close to a form of "revealed preference", where the actual preferences are shown as spending and plans, rather than the political statemens given at the Climate Summits, f.ex. 

I have chosen to focus on actors reporting, rather than observing outcomes or processes for this thesis. As the focus is on understanding how actors see climate adaptation and attempting to understand how that might impact the future.

There are already a broad literature on the effects of climate adaptation and other "grand schemes" ^[See [@ferguson1994;@paprocki2018;@dewan2022] for other examples]

## Modelling OECD data

The OECD Creditor Reporting System is a collection of self-reported activities by the members of the OECD. This is, to the member states and the officials that report, a very serious exersice, but it is also not coordinated beyond the guidance the OECD gives. Automatic (artificial intelligence) coding of the data will give different results. 

This is to this study fine, as I am after what is coded as climate adaptation to analyze what the actors think, and not the other way around. I will not compare across donors, so that inconsistency is handeled. As I have dealt with this dataset earlier during my internship with CONCITO, I was confident in how it functioned. 

I will retrieve the numbers by calling the OECDs API. This ensures I have updated and reproducible numbers for analysis. I will then clean the data by using the `dyplr`-package in `R`, a well known and open statistical program. I have decided to include the code I manipulate the data with in the analysis, so that it is easy to see what I have done and haven't. 

## Analyzing the National Adaptation plans

Are the SIDS-countries representable? No. They are small island countries, so their donor's focus will be on other things than a land-locked country fx. 

The plans are created by the climate adaptation project in one of the members of the World Bank group, in cooperation with different Government actors. 

The plans are obvously the outcome of a brokering process between the local context and how the. 

## Building scenarios 

Based on the Causal Layered analysis, I will identify the key myths in the climate adaptation plans, or at least identify what tey all have in common.
