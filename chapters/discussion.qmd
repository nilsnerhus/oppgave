# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

This section will be stuctured in three parts, one that discusses the research questions, and one that discusses the concepts that keep cropping up. Naturally, this section draws on the findings from all data collection. 

## What is a climate adaptation?

A climate adaptation project is a road building project. It is located in a large, donor-darlig country in Western Africa. 

This is for two possible reasons:

- Roads are ubiqutous
- Highways are a popular imaginary

Roads are, in most Global South settings, the same as transportation. Having access to the road network, as many millions of Africans are without, is important. Both to be viwsible to the State and international community [@ferguson1994], and to have access to markets for goods and labor. With the increase in 

At the same time, highways are very strongly connected to the idea of the American dream, and a specific kind of freedom. This understanding of freedom is powerful to the ruling class in the countries, and as the highways are being built around the western world every day. They are easily understood by funding agencies, as most of them are based in, or have staff familiar with, the USA. Economic growth is highlighted in the NAPs as central to adaptation, as more money in the bank (or pocket) reduces vulnerability to all risks. 

The donor decides what to fund, and as long as the international community is picking up the tab for climate change related ills, governments spend the money elsewhere or not at all.

## How will climate adaptation shape the future?



## Vulnerability and adaptation

How does vulnerability relate to economic development? How does economic development relate to adaptation? Is this just normal development under a new name, mainstreaming? [@scoville-simonds2020].

Remembering the categories from, the focus on economic growth places those projects within the "Institutional development"-frame. This is different from the nexus approaches most found in the literature [@sec-nexus]. 

## Security

The security problems highlighted (or created) by climate change. 

## Alternatives

A human - and not infrastructure - centered climate adaptation? That will look way more like
