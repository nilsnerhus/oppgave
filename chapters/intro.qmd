# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This thesis concludes five years spent at the University. Throughout this time, the world has changed dramatically:

- In 2020, the pandemic struck. […]
- In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine […]
- In 2024, Israel responded to Hamas' terror attack with a full scale invasion […]
- In 2025, the Trump administration and the world's richest man cut 40% of global aid from one day to another

At the same time, the world has started experiencing the results of 200 years of greenhouse emissions:

- Floods in Germany and Spain […]
- Kiribati to buy land abroad […]
- Wildfires in LA […]


The focus of this thesis are the actions taken to adapt to climate change. The goal is not to predict the future, but rather to better understand what the actors in this space, NGOs, academics, or governments think climate adaptation means. As well as to understand their room for maneuver and what they plan to do today, and in the future.

This thesis takes a novel approach. It combines theories and concepts from the field of Anthropology of Development, with their epistemological critiques of development and development projects, with quantitative methods better known from other fields.

## Climate security as Human Security {#sec-humsec}

A central part of the discussion is vulnerability, risk, and security. Human Security, as an approach to research, challenges the traditional realpolitik-paradigm and focuses security as "something more than the top-down military defense of state interests and territory" [@paris2001, p. 88]. It broadens the understanding of security; horizontally to include more threats and vertically to include more actors [@paris2001, p. 98]. Importantly for climate adaptation, Human Security includes risks to the biosphere and the ecosystems the world relies on, as well as the concrete risk to the individual. The individual might now experience a greater risk to their food security, environmental security, community security and personal security [@undp1994]. 

The critique of development from the perspective of the anthropology of development is that interventions rarely eliminate vulnerabilities. Rather, vulnerabilities are shifted from one group to another, from one scale to another or from one place to another [@scoville-simonds2020;@eriksen2021]. Climate adaptation is special because of its orientation to the future. It is unclear how severe, how often, in what kind and where the damages will come. It is a reconstruction without destruction that relies on both the forecasts from climate science, and a specific understanding of the future, to decide what society is going to keep and discard. How we decide to frame the risk, vulnerability, and tool we use to safeguard ourselves from the future, is an inherently ontological and epistemological question. Without a proper understanding of climate adaptation, we run the risk of maladaptation, where the vulnerability to climate damage is not minimized, just moved around. 

## Scope

This thesis seeks to understand climate adaptation funding flows, on a global scale. Since this funding, and its discourse, is anchored in the UNFCCC, it is a natural focal point for the study. The declarations made at the end of every Climate Summit are the outcome of intense negotiations at the summit, and their contents become a part national political debates all around the world [source]. 

What *is* climate adaptation?

- What is the impact of climate adaptation on are North-South finance flows?
- What are the most common climate adaptation interventions? What do they replace?

What *impact* will climate adaptation have?

- What futures do climate adaptation projects have? What are their implications?
- How are climate adaptation interventions justified? Who decides?

## Structure of the thesis

This thesis is structured in three parts. Following this introduction, I present climate adaptation as a part of the international structure for climate change governance [@sec-context]. Then, I present the two main understandings of climate adaptation in the scientific literature [@sec-lit].

In the second part, I present the research design. Here, I explain the different ontological and epistemological views on the future and how they can be analyzed [@sec-theory], before I present my data collection and analysis through regression and structured topic models [@sec-methods].

In the last part, I will present the findings from my study [@sec-findings] and discuss how they should be understood [@sec-discussion], before I conclude the thesis [@sec-conclusion].
