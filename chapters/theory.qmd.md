# Theory: Adaptation for the future {#sec-theory}

In this theory section, I will present the theoretical framework that informs the analysis later in the thesis, based on Arturo Escobar's notion of the _pluriverse_ [@escobar2018;@escobar2020].

I will first present adaptation as a discourse about the future, to understand how climate adaptation constructs particular visions of what is to come.

Then I will present ways of understanding the future through critical future studies, to examine the epistemological and ontological assumptions made when envisioning climate adaptation.

Last, I will present the anglobal discourse and defuturing as the central critique of the global system and its implications for climate adaptation.

## Adaptation as a discourse about the future

Climate adaptation is fundamentally oriented toward the future. Unlike climate mitigation, which seeks to prevent future impacts by reducing emissions in the present, adaptation accepts that some climate impacts are inevitable and focuses on preparing for them. This future orientation makes adaptation discourse a particularly revealing window into how different actors imagine and construct possible futures.

When governments and development agencies plan adaptation interventions, they are not simply responding to objective climate projections. They are engaging in what can be called "anticipatory governance" [@guston2014] - creating institutions, practices, and discourses that attempt to manage uncertain futures. The ways these futures are imagined and prioritized are inherently political, reflecting power dynamics in global climate governance.

As the adaptation regime literature makes clear [@sec-regime], the construction of countries as "climate vulnerable" establishes particular relationships between donors and recipients. These relationships shape how adaptation needs are articulated and which interventions are deemed appropriate. The discourse of adaptation thus becomes a site where future possibilities are opened or foreclosed.

The Dissonance Index methodology I develop in this thesis provides a way to empirically analyze this discourse. By measuring the variation in how adaptation is conceptualized across different actors, sectors, and contexts, we can begin to understand which futures are being privileged and which are being marginalized in global adaptation governance.

## Critical future studies: Epistemological and ontological assumptions

Critical future studies examines how futures are imagined, constructed, and materialized through social and political processes. Central to this examination are the epistemological and ontological assumptions that underlie different approaches to the future.

Epistemologically, how we claim to know the future shapes what kinds of adaptation responses seem reasonable or possible. Climate adaptation typically operates through three main epistemological frames:

1. Predictive modeling that claims to know future climate impacts through scientific projection
2. Scenario planning that acknowledges uncertainty but attempts to bound it within a range of possible futures
3. Adaptive management that emphasizes ongoing learning and adjustment rather than fixed planning

Each of these approaches makes different assumptions about what can be known about the future and how that knowledge should inform action in the present. The dominance of predictive modeling in much adaptation planning, for example, privileges technical expertise over other ways of knowing the future, including indigenous and local knowledge systems that might draw on historical patterns and relational understandings of environmental change.

Ontologically, different conceptions of what the future is shape adaptation discourse in profound ways. Is the future a space of possibility that can be actively shaped through collective action? Or is it a predetermined trajectory that can only be accommodated through technical adjustments? The answers to these questions reflect deeper assumptions about agency, causality, and the nature of time itself.

These epistemological and ontological assumptions are rarely made explicit in adaptation planning documents or funding decisions. However, they fundamentally shape which adaptation pathways are considered viable and which are dismissed as unrealistic or impractical. By analyzing patterns in adaptation discourse using the Dissonance Index, we can begin to identify which assumptions dominate in different contexts and how they constrain or enable different future possibilities.

## The anglobal discourse and defuturing

The third key element of this theoretical framework is the concept of the "anglobal discourse" - a term I use to capture various critiques of Western-dominated global systems including technoscience, Western capitalist modernity, neoliberalism, capitalist realism, and business-as-usual approaches to development. This anglobal discourse functions as what Mark Fisher calls "capitalist realism" [@fisher2009] - the sense that there is no alternative to the current system, and that adaptation must occur within existing political and economic frameworks rather than transforming them.

The concept of "defuturing" [@fry2009] helps us understand how the anglobal discourse constrains adaptation possibilities. Defuturing refers to practices, systems, and discourses that actively reduce the range of possible futures. In climate adaptation, defuturing occurs when dominant discourses naturalize certain development pathways while making alternatives seem impossible or unreasonable.

We see this defuturing at work when climate adaptation becomes, as Dewan describes, merely "the spice" added to conventional infrastructure projects to secure funding [@dewan2022]. The fundamental assumptions about what development should look like remain unchanged, with climate considerations merely grafted onto existing models. Similarly, when vulnerability to climate change is framed primarily as a technical problem requiring technical solutions, deeper questions about the political and economic systems that produce vulnerability are sidelined.

The anglobal discourse reinforces this defuturing by promoting a uniform vision of adaptation that aligns with Western development models. When adaptation is conceptualized primarily through market mechanisms, technological fixes, and risk management approaches derived from Western scientific traditions, it narrows rather than expands the field of possible futures.

The pluriverse concept developed by Escobar offers a counterpoint to this defuturing tendency. Rather than a single, universal model of adaptation that can be applied globally, the pluriverse emphasizes the legitimacy of multiple adaptation pathways emerging from different ontological and epistemological traditions. This framework recognizes that meaningful adaptation must engage with the diverse ways communities understand their relationships with environments and envision their futures.

The Dissonance Index methodology connects directly to these theoretical concerns. By measuring variation in adaptation discourse across different actors and contexts, we can assess to what extent current adaptation governance reflects pluriversal possibilities or anglobal constraints. Low dissonance (high consensus) in adaptation discourse across diverse contexts may indicate the dominance of the anglobal discourse, while high dissonance could suggest either greater openness to diverse adaptation pathways or simply fragmentation and lack of coordination.

This theoretical framework positions the empirical analysis that follows as an intervention in debates about whose futures matter in climate adaptation governance. By examining patterns of centralization or diversification in adaptation discourse, we can better understand how power operates through the construction of futures and begin to identify spaces where alternative adaptation pathways might emerge.
