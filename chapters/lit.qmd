# Literature review: Nexus and regime {#sec-lit}

As mentioned above [@sec-context], this section will present the two main strands of climate adaptation research. One is sympathetic, the adaptation nexus, while the other is critical, the adaptation regime. Climate adaptation is concerned with vulnerability to climate damages, and the main disagreement is in the production of vulnerability. 

The literature in this field maps onto the thinking in the field of development studies, where the study of interventions, projects that seek to change societies abroad, has a long theoretical history. 

## Adaptation nexus {#sec-nexus}

This approach has its roots in participatory movements in the 1990s, critiquing the then paradigm of top-down development research and practice, preoccupied with governmental institutions [@freire1970;@chambers1994]. The researcher was not to observe and report, but had the ethical responsibility to include and empower the communities they researched [@desai2006]. New methods were developed to better map communities and engage them in knowledge production, such as participatory rural appraisal [source]. 

The data collected was used with new analytical framework centering the individual and communities. These frameworks analyzed how livelihoods were stitched together with a mix of assets, endowments, capabilities [@sen2000], shaped by access [@ribot2003] and aspirations [@appadurai2004], amongst others. This gave valuable insight into how societies functioned, and sparked new forms of interventions, with a focus on co-management and knowledge transfer. 

This strand of research has since become a part of the mainstream development discourse, and variations on the participatory methods being implemented by the largest aid organizations like the World Bank [source]. They see climate adaptation as just one policy area amongst all the others, and is searching for some key sectors and for synergies between them [source]. 

One example of this could be tree planting projects, that while their main purpose is carbon sequestration, the project could contribute in many ways:

- Economic security through the sale of forest carbon credits to the global north. If the tree is planted as a part of a farming system as a form agroforestry, the wood could be seen as a form of long-term investment that could be harvested in 30 years
- Food security through production of fruit
- Gender equality by giving the responsibility for managing the trees to women
- Environmental security by providing shade with leaves and reduce soil erosion with roots. 

The nexus understanding sees vulnerability as an individual's *lack* of certain skill, capability, or access to a resource. When the right resource is given, it is expected to start an upwards spiral, where outcomes will improve in all other fields as well. 

## Adaptation regime {#sec-regime}

The adaptation regime has its roots in the deconstructionist anthropology of development [@lewis2006]. It is heavily influenced by the work of Michael Foucault, and critiques of the *discourse of development*. The discourse, as "a system of knowledge practices, technologies, and power relationships" that orders the relationships between people and institutions. [@lewis2006, p. 4]. 

The discourses that order the relationships between rich and poor countries change over time, and development had replaced civilization, just as civilization had replaced God before it [@ferguson1994]. 1 The seminal pieces here are @escobar1995's deconstruction of the development discourse in Latin-America and the start of a post-development field of study and @ferguson1994's deconstruction of development projects, and finding that the projects fail in predictable ways. 

As nature and climate discourses grew to prominence, @agrawal2005 argued that the new relationships should be understood as a form of *environmentality*. @paprocki2018 describes it as an *Adaptation regime* based on her field work in Bangladesh. She argues that some countries are constructed as climate vulnerable and therefore in need of climate adaptation and that this imaginary is closely related to other historical processes of colonialism. All societal issues are reduced to be climate related, and unavoidable. This dystopian imaginary builds the groundwork for extensive experimentation, since the dystopian outlook eliminates the possible downsides. This, she argues, leads to dispossession as land is taken for shrimp aquaculture and migration to the cities is promoted. The poor and vulnerable that were supposed to be helped, simply are not [@paprocki2018].

@dewan2022 further develops this, highlighting the building of dams and polders as flood protection. She argues the polders built as a climate adaptation measure, are the same as the old for flood protection, and are successful at acquiring funding. Climate adaptation was *the spice* that made their applications for funding work. The only issue was that the polders did not work. By blocking the seasonal flooding and draining, the rivers became silted and needed dredging, furthering the risk of floods [@dewan2022].
