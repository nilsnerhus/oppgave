# Motivation {#sec-motivation}

This thesis concludes five years spent at the University. Throughout this time, the world has changed dramatically:

- In 2020, the pandemic struck. Most of the world experienced extensive lock-downs, a rise in crime and anti-social 
- In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in blatant disregard of international law. This led to a reconfiguring of the global economy that we are only seeing the beginning of.
- In 2024, Israel responded to Hamas' terror attact with a full scale invasion of Gaza. This has created a new landscape, where Israels leaders are wanted by the ICC, and 
- Tensions are rising between China and Taiwan

With the reelection of Donald Trump as President in the USA, some have claimed we are seeing the end of the neoliberal era and of a unipolar, rule-based global order, with strong man politics taking over 

At the same time, the world has started expirencing the results of 200 years of greenhouse emissions:

- Flood in Germany and Spain
- Sea level rise forcing Kiribati to buy land abroad
- Wildfires in LA leading to the loss both culture and 
- Land slides in Uganda?

As I will expand on in the next section this has led to changes in international climate change governance as well. 

## Climate security as Human Security

Taken together, the possible end of the neoliberal world order and the rise of climate change as the central international problematic, climate security and all the different conceptualizations of it, are set to get a larger chunk of the North-South aid flows. 

Safety is the absence of a security problem, while security is a security problem with a security solution. If there was no climate change, or we did not deem it a threat to our security, we would be climate safe.

With the popularization of the Human Security framework by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the 1990s, the understanding of security expanded from its historical roots focussing exclusivly on sovereinity and the State. It expanded vertically, to include common goods such as ecosystems and the biosphere and individuals, and horizontally, to include food security, enviornment security and community securty, amongst others.

Security was conceptualized as "Freedom from want and freedom from fear". The idea was one person struggling somewhere, could be the one to create insecurity somewhere else. 

As climate change is a trans-scalar, global issues, adapting to it will similarly be trans-scalar and global. With its interdisiplinary and interconnected understanding of security, climate security fits well within the environmental security pillar of the Human Security framework one of the seven key pillars of the Human Security framework. 

Here, security is understood as something more than just a geopolitical and realpolitik, encompassing the security of ecosystems and of individuals. Climate security is a multi-level issue. Droughts, floods and other extremes caused by climate change could impact the livelihoods of many, and possible threaten peace and security in society at large. 

## Futures unknown

It is a process of adaptation to risks of change. It is a reconstruction of the world to adapt to dangers that we do not know the full extent of. Most theory today assumes that climate adaptation can, and will come, as a win-win for people, climate and economy. 

Climate adaptation is special because of its orientation to the future. It is a reconstruction without destruction. It relies on both the forecasts from climate science, as well as a specific understanding of the future. Climate science is based on increased risk to catastrophic events. As it is a global, multi-level issue this risk could be to virtually everything

Most of the literature on this assumes the neoliberal world order, even though the conceptualize it differently. These ontological and epistemological decitions, as I will expand on in @sec-theory, will shape which futures are chosen, and which futures are discarded. 

This study, then, seeks to understand what climate adaptation is understood as today, and how it is seen in the future. 

## Structure of the thesis

This thesis is structured in three parts. Following this motivation section, the introduction continues, laying out the context, earlier research and scope of the thesis. 

In the second part, the research design will be presented. There, I will explain the different ontological and epistemological views on the future, my emphasis on the *tools* of climate adaptation, and the methods I will use to 

In the third part, I will present the findings from my study and discuss how they should be understood as a part of the development and climate adaptation literature, before I conclude the thesis.
