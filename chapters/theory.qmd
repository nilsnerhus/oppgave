# Theory: Pluriversal politics {#sec-theory}

In this theory section, I will present the theoretical framework that informs the analyzis later in the thesis, based on Arturo Escobar's notion of the *pluriverse* [@escobar2018;@escobar2020]. 

I will first present the defuturing as the central critique of the global system. 

Then I will present ways of understanding the future, to understand the epistemological and ontological assumptions made when envisioning the future. 

Last, I will present the pluriverse as an alternative goal for development and climate adaptation.
