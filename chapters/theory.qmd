# Theory: Adaptation for the future {#sec-theory}

In this theory section, I present the theoretical framework that informs the analysis later in the thesis, drawing on critical perspectives from anthropology of development, future studies, and post-structural theory.

I first examine adaptation as a discourse about the future, to understand how climate adaptation constructs particular visions of what is to come. Then I present ways of understanding the future through critical future studies, examining how epistemological and ontological assumptions shape possible futures. Finally, I discuss the anglobal discourse and defuturing as the central critique of the global system and its implications for climate adaptation.

## Adaptation as a discourse about the future

Climate adaptation is fundamentally oriented toward the future. Unlike climate mitigation, which seeks to prevent future impacts by reducing emissions in the present, adaptation accepts that some climate impacts are inevitable and focuses on preparing for them.

When governments and development agencies plan adaptation interventions, they are not simply responding to objective climate projections. They are engaging in what can be called "anticipatory governance" [@guston2014] - creating institutions, practices, and discourses that attempt to manage uncertain futures. The ways these futures are imagined and prioritized are inherently political, reflecting power dynamics in global climate governance.

As the adaptation regime literature makes clear [@sec-regime], the construction of countries as "climate vulnerable" establishes particular relationships between donors and recipients. These relationships shape how adaptation needs are articulated and which interventions are deemed appropriate. The discourse of adaptation thus becomes a site where future possibilities are opened or foreclosed [source].

The Dissonance Index methodology I develop in this thesis provides a way to empirically analyze this discourse. By measuring the variation in how adaptation is conceptualized across different actors, sectors, and contexts, we can begin to understand the degree of fragmentation or centralization in global adaptation discourse. Greater fragmentation would indicate more diverse understandings of what adaptation means and how it should be pursued, reflecting a greater plurality of epistemological and ontological positions.

## Epistemological and ontological foundations of possible futures

Critical future studies examines how futures are imagined, constructed, and materialized through social and political processes. A central insight from this field is that what futures are deemed possible depends fundamentally on epistemological and ontological assumptions about the world [source].

Epistemologically, how we claim to know the world shapes what kinds of futures seem reasonable or possible. Different knowledge systems—whether scientific, indigenous, religious, or otherwise—generate different understandings of how change occurs and what possibilities exist. These epistemological differences are not merely academic; they materially affect which future visions are privileged and which are marginalized in policy discourse [source].

Ontologically, different understandings of what the world is shape future visions in profound ways. Ontological assumptions concern fundamental questions about agency (who or what can act), causality (how change happens), and the nature of time and space themselves. Different cultural and philosophical traditions offer diverse ontological frameworks that structure how futures are imagined and enacted [source].

These epistemological and ontological assumptions are rarely made explicit in policy documents or funding decisions. However, they fundamentally shape which future possibilities are considered viable and which are dismissed as unrealistic or impractical [source].

The Dissonance Index allows us to analyze the degree to which these diverse epistemological and ontological perspectives are present in adaptation discourse. Higher fragmentation in the discourse would indicate greater epistemological and ontological plurality - more diverse ways of knowing and being in relation to futures. Lower fragmentation would suggest the dominance of particular ways of knowing and being, limiting the range of futures considered legitimate or feasible [source].

## The anglobal discourse and defuturing

The third key element of this theoretical framework is the concept of the "anglobal discourse" [@sun2025] - a term that I use here to connect various post-structural critiques of Western-dominated global systems including technoscience [@slaughter2024], Western capitalist modernity [@escobar2018], neoliberalism [@escobar1995] and capitalist realism [@goode2017].

The anglobal discourse main characteristic is this context is its connection to the concept of "defuturing" [@fry2019]. Defuturing refers to practices, systems, and discourses that actively reduce the range of possible futures. When dominant discourses naturalize certain pathways while making alternatives seem impossible or unreasonable, they engage in defuturing—actively diminishing rather than expanding future possibilities [@escobar2020].

We see this defuturing at work in climate policy when adaptation becomes, as Dewan describes, merely "the spice" added to conventional infrastructure projects to secure funding [@dewan2022]. The fundamental assumptions about what development should look like remain unchanged, with climate considerations merely grafted onto existing models [@paprocki2018]. Similarly, when climate vulnerability is framed primarily as a technical problem requiring technical solutions, deeper questions about the political and economic systems that produce vulnerability are sidelined [source].

The anglobal discourse is characterized by low fragmentation - a high degree of centralization and uniformity in how futures are conceptualized. This uniformity constrains the range of possible futures that can be imagined and pursued. By contrast, higher fragmentation in discourse would indicate more diverse understandings of the future, potentially allowing for approaches that challenge or exist outside the anglobal discourse [source].

The Dissonance Index methodology connects directly to these theoretical concerns. By measuring variation in adaptation discourse across different actors and contexts, we can assess to what extent current adaptation governance reflects a diversity of epistemological and ontological positions or the dominance of the anglobal discourse. Low dissonance (high consensus) in adaptation discourse across diverse contexts would indicate the dominance of the anglobal discourse and its associated defuturing effects. High dissonance would suggest greater epistemological and ontological plurality, potentially enabling a wider range of future possibilities.

This theoretical framework positions the empirical analysis that follows as an intervention in debates about whose futures matter in climate adaptation governance. By examining patterns of centralization or diversification in adaptation discourse, we can better understand how power operates through the construction of futures and begin to identify spaces where alternative pathways might emerge.
