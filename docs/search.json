This thesis seeks to understand the role climate adaptation plays today, and how it will shape the future. It is a common assumption that climate adaptation is “green”, a claim I will investigate through a mixed-methods approach.\nFirst, it analyzes data from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System to see how North-South finance flows have changed over the last ten years. It finds that while the amount of aid tagged as climate adaptation is rising, it is not across the board. This leads to a structural shift in aid, where a larger part of aid is out in construction, transport and energy.\nSecond, it analyzes the National Adaptation Plans submitted to the UNFCCC, through the Causal Layered Analysis framework. It finds that, despite the planned interventions amount to a total rewiring of the economy on all levels, they fail to envision a different future. The interventions, rather, seem to believe there is no alternative to the destructive system that have caused climate change in the first place.\nLastly, the thesis suggests more research into new ways of understanding climate adaptation, and highlights promising work by authors in the fields of futurology, design and development. Based on these different conceptualizations, I construct three different scenarios for the future of climate adaptation.\n\n\nAcknowledgements",

Droughts, floods and other extremes caused by climate change could impact the livelihoods of many, and possible threaten peace and security in society at large.\nSecurity is also concerned with anticipating and avoiding risk. This means looking into the future.\nClimate adaptation is special because of its orientation to the future. It is a process of adaptation to risks of change. It is a reconstruction of the world to adapt to dangers that we do not know the full extent of. Most theory today assumes that climate adaptation can, and will come, as a win-win for people, climate and economy.\nIn Scandinavia, climate security (klimasikring) and climate adaptation (klimatilpasning) is used interchangebly. I will use climate adaptation thorughout the rest of the thesis, because this is the language of the UNFCCC.",

    "section": "1.2 International climate change governance",
    "text": "1.2 International climate change governance\nWhile mitigating climate change perhaps is most important, adapting (and shielding) people, industries and nations from the risks of climate change is growing in prominence. At the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai, an agreement was signed that the parties should make $1300 billon available, every year, for climate adaptation.\nGovernments and civil society organizations around the world welcomed this, as the poorest in the world are the most vulnerable to climate change. Climate adaptation is therefore possibly becoming the new interface for financial aid between the Global North and the Global South. Most of the discourse around climate adaptation assumes many win-win scenarios.\nThe UNFCCC has three pillars: Mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage (Hall and Persson 2018).\nThe mitigation pillar has been a part of the UNFCCC since the Kyoto protocolls in [way back then], and is perhaps the most important part of the Convention. Since the Paris agreement (COP21) in 2015, all parties to the Convention has to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years.\nMeasures within the mitigation pillar span the whole economy, and is a process internal to every country, with the exeption of different carbon trading regimes, such as UN REDD+ or the European carbon trading system (ECTS).\nClimate adapation is measures aimed at limiting the damage caused by unmitigated climate change. It is, in a sense, the spillovereffect from unsuccessful mitigation.\nClimate adaptation is at its simplest all infrastructure and change that is aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change (Ensor and Berger 2009). Some expand this understanding to include exploiting the opportunities climate change can bring with it (Vanhala and Hestbaek 2016). This definition makes it possible to frame most infrastructure development as climate adaptation measures (Toussaint 2021). Climate adaptation is largely financed by the state where the infrastructure is built, although a larger degree of ODA is spent on climate adaptation related infrastructure (Dewan 2022).\nLoss and damage is the newest pillar, and its distinction from climate adaptation is muddied. When it was first brought it up, it was intended as a formalized and legalized form of climate compensation. It was supposed to pay for losses and damages that occurred beyond the limits of adaptation (Janzen et al. 2021). This is not the version adopted by the UNFCCC. Loss and damage is to be financed through the same channels as adaptation, and will be mainstreamed into development assistance (Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020).\nThe logic of the UNFCCC then becomes: All countries must cut their emissions. The impacts of unmitigated climate change must be adapted and what is beyond adaptation must be paid for as damages.\nWhile the distinctions I present here are true, they are not popularly adapted, and as I will highligh in Section 3.4, many approaches to climate change seek to impact (or subvert) all pillars simultainously.\nClimate change finance is a billion-dollar industry, and scholars claim climate adaptation is increasingly being funded with funds from other policy areas (Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020). The money is funneled into a growing amount of international funds dedicated to climate adaptation, and existing projects are being recast as adaptation projects (Dewan 2022; Paprocki 2018).\nThis shift, and the shift to project work is well described in the literature, and something I will expand on below. Thus, the goal of this project is to better understand this shift on the global level, and attempt to chart out where climate adaptation is today, and how it will shape the future.",

    "text": "1.3 Climate adaptation as a new paradigm\nThe Anthropology of Development, as the critical analysis of development actors and their projects has a long history. Thinkers like Ferguson (1994) and his analysis of the Anti-politics machine in Lesotho and (escobar1995?) and the discourse of underdevelopment in Latin America have highlighted and spurred research into why development seems to always miss targets and fail in predictable ways.\nScholars have recently begun the work of deconstructing the climate adaptation discourse. Paprocki (2018) describes it as an Adaptation regime based on her field work in Bangladesh. She argues that some countries are constructed as climate vulnerable and therefore in need of climate adaptation and that this imaginary is closely related to other historical processes of colonialism. All societal issues are reduced to be climate related, and unavoidable. This dystopian imaginary builds the groundwork for extensive experimentation, since the dystopian outlook eliminates the possible downsides. This, she argues, leads to dispossession as land is taken for shrimp aquaculture and migration to the cities is promoted. The poor and vulnerable that were supposed to be helped, simply are not (Paprocki 2018).\nDewan (2022) further develops this, highlighting the building of dams and polders as flood protection. She argues the polders built as a climate adaptation measure, are the same as the old for flood protection, and are successful at acquiring funding. Climate adaptation was the spice that made their applications for funding work. The only issue was that the polders did not work. By blocking the seasonal flooding and draining, the rivers became silted and needed dredging, furthering the risk of floods (Dewan 2022).\nThis will all sort under the mitigation pillar of the UNFCCC, the first of three. All actions taken to avoid global warming and the following climate change, falls into this category. That also includes taxes on emissions and renewable power, as well as many other more or less effective measures.\nThe second pillar, adopted in [say, 2015] is climate adaptation. It involves all measures taken to avoid the causes of global warming. Building sea walls to keep storm surges out of urban areas, shielding argiculture from exsessive rain\nThe third of the UNFCCC, adpoted in [say, 2022] is loss and damage, conserning all damages from global warming that are beyond adaptation. This pillar is highly disputed, as it was originally proposed as a way of bringing a judicial understanding of climate justice into play, where countries could sue other countries for the losses and damages their emissions had caused. While this is not the understanding adapted by the UNFCCC, where it is just seen as another form of climate adaptation.\n\n\n\n\nDewan, Camelia. 2022. “‘Climate Change as a Spice’: Brokering Environmental Knowledge in Bangladesh’s Development Industry.” Ethnos 87 (3): 538–59. https://doi.org/10.1080/00141844.2020.1788109.\n\n\nEnsor, Jonathan, and Rachel Berger. 2009. “Understanding Community-Based Adaptation.” In Understanding Climate Change Adaptation : Lessons from Community-Based Approaches, 1–38.

    "text": "3.1 New security\nSecurity is seen as combination of a security problem with a security solution (Wæver 1995). Interestingly, it is the absence of security solutions that creates insecurity, not the presence of the threat. This idea makes perfect security impossible to achieve (Baldwin 1997, 15). It is a concept with deep historical roots, it has traditionally been associated with military power and state building, but has also included other values and other actors. The values security guards, what is secured, is subject for debate, and has changed throughout history and between contexts (Baldwin 1997, 13).\nSince security is unachievable, and has a cost, it is no more than just another policy objective for those involved in politics to weigh against other issues, it has marginal value. The value of say, national security, always has to be valued against its costs, and other values, such as human rights (Baldwin 1997, 16). There are two main strains of security thinking; the realpolitik-paradigm, and the human security paradigm.\nThe concept of security was extended in four directions, vertically, up to the international and down to the individual, and horizontally, from military threats to economic, social and other threats (Rothschild 1995, 55). The concept of human security came as the last in a long line of expansions to the notion of security (Paris 2001, 88). The realpolitik-paradigm was deemed to not fit the new post-cold war situation and the new wars that emerged. There was a need for a new framework to ensure the security of all people in the world (UNDP 1994, 49). International politics was no longer a fight between the superpowers, and there was considerable fear the “new wars”, by some seen as a different kind of organized violence taking hold (Kaldor 2012, 1).\nTo feel insecure is more connected to everyday worries and suffering, than it is international headline-grabbing crises (UNDP 1994, 34). Threats against human security somewhere, is a threat to people everywhere (UNDP 1994, 46). These failed states threaten the security of people everywhere, because the new threats would come from individuals and groups, not from nation states (UNDP 1994, 46).",

    "text": "3.2 Securitization of the biosphere\nA central point to the understanding of security is the process of securitization. Here, a topic, event or other peace of politics is made into a security issue. Securitization is not simply to speak louder, but to change the language in witch an issue is discussed in a specific way (Wæver 1995). This language often invokes life or death for the state or society, and often makes references to war (Wæver 1995). Classic examples of this are “the war on terror”, “the war on drugs”, the “war on crime” and the “war on poverty” all not so proud examples from the US.\nSince security is the combination of a security problem with a security solution, and the threats to security has expanded, it is possible to securitize virtually every aspect of society. Securitization has a massive potential to mobilize people to rally behind causes (Wæver 1995). This can be seen in the ability to mobilize troops to fight in actual wars, for states to provide resources to a cause or to shift the debate around an issue.\nSecuritization, with its references to war, often invokes the state as the provider of security (Wæver 1995). As with the example of “war on drugs”, it was not a war for the pharma-businesses to fight, nor was it because it was an health crisis. It was to enable the coercive powers of the state to now focus on a new issue, and to use laws, regulations, taxes, fines and incarceration to get it. Some scholars argue that one should only investigate the impacts of securitization, instead of weather or not an issue has been securitized (Owen 2008, 447). Other argues that securitization itself is defensive. It will reinforce the state of the world like it is today (Wæver 1995).\nClimate security is a securitization of the biosphere and, as I will explore later in this thesis, leads to a focus on the actions and relations between states, rather than other aspects of society.",

    "text": "3.3 North-south interventions\nThere are four main ways of understanding the justifications for interventions by countries in the global north, in countries in the global south (Escobar 2018):\n\nInstitutional development\nParticipatory development\nSecurity development\nAlternative development\n\nThis way of understanding is perhaps the most common, as it involved the World Bank, IMF and the other large multilateral institutions. It assumes that the issues countries face are somehow of their own making and a result of a history of oppression. Through better governance and improved infrastructure, costs of doing business will sink, and spur economic development. Funds will be dispersed at the national level, most often as loans, with conditions attached. These conditions could include the use of private sector instruments1, and mobilization of funds at the project level.\nThe particapatory view is skeptical of the government, both as in its ability to represent its citizens, as well as implementing its policies. By engaging poor populations directly, funds would not be wasted in bureaucracy and corruption. Since funds can target the most vulnerable populations, they make life better. Funds will be dispersed in many of small-scale projects, mediated by an international network of NGOs. The communities that best understand donor preferences, get a larger part of aid flows.\nThe security view sees the era of rapid growth in international trade as over. The United States, Russia, China and the EU moving investment to allies and strategically important parts of the world, through mechanisms such as EU’s Global Gateway and China’s Belt and Road, aiming to sure up their value chains. Funds are either dispersed at the national level, as loans or grants, or through infrastructure deals, where the infrastructure is delivered already assembled. Consultation with other actors that the State is limited.\nPerhaps the most radical on this list, influenced by post-development thinking, the alternative development view rejects development interventions on the whole. Rather, development is sees as an always-ongoing process, where local communities find better solutions when left alone, without distortions from the outside. Funds are not needed for this approach, but cases where a donors’ Ministry for Energy is funding the polluters, and the same donors Ministry for Environment is funding activists to fight the polluters, should be avoided2.\nThe literature on climate adaptation is large and growing rapidly.

I forgot to send myself the file, so I am doing the findings from memory. They are based on a lot of =sumif() calculations done in the 2022 OECD CRS dataset, and highlighted five “key” donors (at least in our contract): Germany, France, Japan, the EU and the UK. It is also based on transcripts of interviews that I still have.\nI found that, within the field of transportation, there was considerable variation between the different donors, both in what they decided to fund, and how they coded their funding. Even though France and Germany are neighboors and the OECD officers meet regulary, their interpretation of sustainability is very different.\nSome thing very visible nonetheless. All train projects were coded as climate mitigation, as well as all road projects were coded as climate adaptation.",

It is located in a large, donor-darlig country in Western Africa.\nThis is for two possible reasons:\nRoads are, in most Global South settings, the same as transportation. Having access to the road network, as many millions of Africans are without, is important. Both to be viwsible to the State and international community (Ferguson 1994), and to have access to markets for goods and labor. With the increase in\nAt the same time, highways are very strongly connected to the idea of the American dream, and a specific kind of freedom. This understanding of freedom is powerful to the ruling class in the countries, and as the highways are being built around the western world every day. They are easily understood by funding agencies, as most of them are based in, or have staff familiar with, the USA. Economic growth is highlighted in the NAPs as central to adaptation, as more money in the bank (or pocket) reduces vulnerability to all risks.\nThe donor decides what to fund, and as long as the international community is picking up the tab for climate change related ills, governments spend the money elsewhere or not at all.",
