# Part 1: Climate adaptation

Part 1 of the thesis establishes climate adaptation as the case study through which broader theoretical questions will be examined. Following a modular thesis approach, Part 1 is designed to be self-contained, providing all necessary context on climate adaptation before introducing the theoretical framework and methodology in subsequent parts.

The part contains two chapters:

- Context
- Literature review

## Context: The Evolution of Climate Governance

The international climate governance framework has evolved significantly since its inception at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initially focused primarily on mitigation efforts, as evidenced by the Kyoto Protocol (1997). However, as climate impacts became increasingly apparent and mitigation efforts proved insufficient, adaptation emerged as a critical second pillar, formally recognized in the Cancun Agreements (2010). This was later complemented by the introduction of loss and damage as a third pillar in the Paris Agreement (2015).

Central to this governance structure is the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities," which acknowledges that while climate change affects all nations, industrialized countries bear greater historical responsibility for emissions and consequently should lead in providing solutions and support. This principle has shaped the power dynamics and decision-making processes within the UNFCCC, particularly regarding financial commitments for adaptation in developing countries.

The adaptation funding landscape includes various mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and the Rio markers system for tracking adaptation finance. Despite pledges like the "$100 billion promise" and the recent $300 billion commitment at COP29 in Baku (2024), actual disbursement patterns reveal significant shortfalls and geographical and sectoral imbalances. These financial frameworks involve complex interactions between public and private financing models, multilateral development banks, bilateral donor frameworks, national governance structures, and non-state actors.

Climate adaptation serves as a particularly revealing window into North-South relations, as it makes visible the power dynamics in global governance. It represents a site of contested futures and epistemologies, with profound relevance to broader debates in development studies and future studies. The conceptual tensions between adaptation as technical adjustment versus social transformation, and its relationship to resilience frameworks and disaster risk reduction, further illustrate why adaptation discourse merits close examination.

## Literature Review: Competing Paradigms in Adaptation Research

The literature on climate adaptation can be broadly categorized into two competing paradigms: the adaptation nexus and the adaptation regime. These approaches differ fundamentally in their epistemological and ontological assumptions about vulnerability, risk, and appropriate interventions.

The adaptation nexus paradigm builds on conceptual foundations in participatory development, drawing from the work of scholars like Chambers and Freire. It focuses on assets, endowments, and capabilities as articulated by Sen, employing analytical frameworks such as sustainable livelihoods and vulnerability assessments. Methodologically, this approach favors participatory rural appraisal and knowledge co-production. Key institutional supporters include UNDP and the World Bank, which promote synergistic sector approaches that seek to address multiple development challenges simultaneously through adaptation interventions.

In contrast, the adaptation regime paradigm emerges from post-structural critiques of development by scholars such as Escobar and Ferguson. It introduces key concepts like environmentality (Agrawal) and the adaptation regime (Paprocki), critically analyzing adaptation discourse as a technique of power. This paradigm employs ethnographic and discourse analysis methods, drawing extensively on case studies from Bangladesh and other climate "hotspots" to illustrate how adaptation can function as mere "spice" for conventional development projects, leading to maladaptation that may exacerbate vulnerability.

These competing paradigms reflect deeper epistemological differences regarding what constitutes valid knowledge about climate risks and appropriate responses. They embody divergent ontological assumptions about vulnerability and operate within different temporal frameworksâ€”with the nexus approach typically favoring short-term adjustments while the regime critique advocates for long-term transformation. The politics of scale are evident in tensions between local versus global knowledge, while questions of agency and power in adaptation decision-making remain contested. The increasing neoliberalization of climate adaptation further complicates this landscape, raising questions about whose interests adaptation interventions ultimately serve.

This literature review sets the stage for examining how these competing conceptualizations of adaptation manifest in funding patterns and planned interventions, which will be analyzed through the theoretical framework and methodology presented in subsequent parts of the thesis.
