## Methods

Overall structure:


Add the following as new paragraphs in the analysis section:

- The topic naming approach. To make sure the topics get human-readable names, they have been qualitativly named using frex, lift and prob words, as well as what the STM-model deems as relevant text chunks, and the top 2 countries for that topic. 
- The rarefaction approach to make the values comparable across sample size. Has a high minimum group size (8). Also produces a confidence interval that will be visible 
- The variance partitioning approach. For one topic: Calculates the mean and overall variation across all categories. Then calculates the group mean, and the distance to the overall mean weighted per country. Then divide the between group variance by the total variance. It is then averaged per group, across all topics.
