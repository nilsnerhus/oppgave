# Structure

The thesis follows a specific view of academic knowledge production, believing that it is done through a case and a research design, combined to create an analysis. 

The case will always produce a *debate*, and questions being discussed. This is because it is no need for research into settled questions. 

The research design will always create a model, spanning from informal conceptual models, all the way to formal mathematical models. 

Part 1 has the following goals:

- Establishing climate adaptation as a significant site of North-South relations
- Documenting the competing research paradigms, their historical roots and possible implications
- Setting up the empirical case that will be analyzed through the theoretical framework in Part 2

Part 2 has the following goals:

- Developing a robust theoretical framework for analyzing adaptation discourse
- Creating a novel methodological approach for measuring discourse centralization
- Setting up the analytical framework for interpretation in Part 3

Part 3 as the following goals:

- Presenting the findings from the part 2 in a clear and convincing way
- Discussing the findings againt part 1
- Setting up the conclusion

Each part should be around 20 pages, with 2400 characters per page.
