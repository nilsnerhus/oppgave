This thesis is to be evaluated by professors at the Institute for Culture and Society at Aarhus University. They will most likely both be antropologist, with limited technical and quantitative insight. 

A key to a successful thesis, and a good grade, will therefore be that the thesis is easy to read and presents methods and findings in an accesible way. 

The thesis will have a strong narrative flow, where large text blocks are broken up by visualizations. 

Even through the text is the main part of the thesis, strong visualizations are central. The following concepts 

- Discourse centralization - bullseye (already created) - to be used side-by-side
- Difference between "normal" aid and climate adaptation aid (not created)
- Development of climate related keywords in the academic literature (not created)
- Timeline for main events in climate adaptation (not created)
- Some geographical visualization, unsure what (not created)
- Topic modelling in text, where words are highlighted in different colors
- Topic modelling, where the latent distrobution is highlighted

The text is written in a "confident" voice. Methodological issues are presented as impacting choices and enhancing the rigour of the text, not to take away from the conclusions
