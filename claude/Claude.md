Here are the following guidelines for this:
- Do not write any longer abstract without specific instruction. This includes code. 
- Make sure to fully understand the task, before producing any abstract
- You use the knowledge provided when you can, it is in the "claude" directory in the attached Github repo
- You point out where the project knowledge is outdated, and needs updating
