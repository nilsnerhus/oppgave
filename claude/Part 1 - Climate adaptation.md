This section attempts to build climate adaptation as a case that can be researched. First by establishing it as a part of the UNFCCC system, before reviewing the literature about it.
# Context 9,8/10 pages

The introduction/readers guide presents:

1. What the UNFCCC is. Political areana. Bathtub-argument. 
2. Mitigation, its connection to economics. Carbon credits.
3. Adaptation, its connection to development. Aid
4. Loss and damage, its connection to transitional justice. Reperations.

Current version:

- Remove sections on conventions and CBDR in intro. Boring
- Rewrite the intro to new outline
- Find sources for the billions of dollars-claims. Preferably from the UNFCCC itself

## Climate justice at the UNFCCC

Current version:

- Move up to the start of the chapter. 
- Move up the sections that explains the international body stuff.
- Remove references to country groups, I will not discuss them
- Remove discussion of other frameworks than the bathtub, but highlight what is missed by it anyway

Future version:

- The UNFCCC is an international political body. That means nations are the parties, and they are in a political struggle, and the outcomes are shaped by that.
- The view of climate as a series of bathtubs where climate change leads to environmental change, which can cause damage. That is not justice. If climate change is mitigated, the damage will not happen. That is justice. If environmental change is adapted to, the damage will not happen. That is justice. If the damage is compensated. That is justice. 
- Countries are attempting to both achieve as much progress as possible, and to avoid responisbility as much as possible.
- The UNFCCC is also the arena for everyone connected to climate work, so consultants, politicans, NGOs and businesses all congregate (if not literally, so in their focus)
- Everything that is not mitigation is a side-payment for the lack of commitment to make sure the UNFCCC maintains consensus

## Mitigation

Current version:

- Consider removing the actual names of the different flexible mechanisms, and just call them flexible mechanisms. 
- Consider making the middle-income countries have more to say in flexible mechanisms more clear (as we will get back to it). Also find a source. 

Future version

- Expand with a section on green colonialism. Focus on SÃ¡mi in Norway [@wing2017;nim], wind farms in Mexico [@dunlap2018], carbon credit plantations in Uganda [@mousseau2019] and sacrafice zones [@juskus2023;@tornel2024;@wilhite2019]. 
- Add a discussion of the idea behind climate finance and mobilizing private finance [@buchner2023;@stern2022;@asiandevelopmentbank2008;@lawrence2024]. Not really that it is bad, just that it is very not-new. The word is something mixed, but I do not remember what. 
- Add that climate finance in development assistance is said to be rising (wish I had the time to show ODA-numbers, but I don't), and that it is unclear if it actually is something new [@slente2024;@scoville-simonds2020]. It is also unclear if it is needed.
- Add in a section that the problem of climate mitigation is a political economy one, not necesarrily a development one. This is an ~~easy~~ solvable political question. Each dollar spent is spent on something. 
	- Shift spending to less polluting sectors/products - through tax/ets-systems
	- Shift spender (from private to public) - from consumerism to care [@foller2024]
	- Spend less - mitigation - This is essencially the degrowth argument
- If one adopts a finance-view of this, then CPI numbers show that the world is still spending way more on fossil fuel *subsidies* than on green stuff. So shifting the spending is actually free, in a monetary sense. And if international cooprorations and development banks withdrew from extracivism, then most countries have a real shot at a limited industrialization for the local market.
- The climate finance stuff is in a way a rebound of mainstream economic thought from the 2000s, with shock therapy (rapid decarbonation) and proto-facistical thoughts of restructuring whole societies in record time.
- Add in the fact that a lot of different scholars are working on it, and some are calling to rethink it [@mazzucato2021;@bastani2019;@vettese2022;@raworth2017]. Public finance is also something discussed in Modern Monetary Policy [@kelton2020]

All this to say, I want this section to ground climate mitigation in macro-economics in the North and development economics in the South. 

## Adaptation

Current version

- I actually think this section is complely alright. 

Future version:

- Add a discussion of vulnerability, and how it is handled in the North and South (with insurance vs. capability)
- Put more emphasis on the fact that it comes from a lack of climate action, not as any enhanced thing. The side-payment analogy is also important because it might not be internationally, but meant to serve a domestic audience. Easier for a norwegian to back continued oil exploration when we think the damage will be adaptated away from. 
- Ah, there is no discussion of *maladaptation*, I would very much like to have that out of the way before we start the literature review [@schipper2020;@eriksen2021].
- Add a discussion of @ferguson1994 line with God -> Empire -> Development (-> Adaptation). We are going to be adapting to climate change for the rest of my life, either way, as we have been developing before, and civilizing before that again. It might become the new default way of observing the world. 

The goal is to set it up as an interesting case. And to place it in the bathtub-analogy. 

## Loss and damage

Current version:

- Remove diect mentiones of InsuResilience

Future version:

- Include the link to transitional justice. Complicate it with the fact that it is compensations for damage to be done in the future. 
- Include the idea of loss and damage as a side payment. 
- Also that the adaptation frontier also is technologically bound, so in theory everything *could* be adapted, but it is a question of finance, will and opportunity cost. 
- Also add a small discussion of the idea of a *victim* [@dvorak2018;@krystalli2021], and how it forces the countries to behave as such, and that some are said to be both fighting it and not [@nakate2021;@brun2016;@ourbak2018;@corbett2020;@carter2020]
- Also the complicated nature of who owns what and how. Also the RMI story: [@mcclain2020;@kirsch2020]

This section is meant to highlight that also this will be very difficult. It is going to be RMI-heavy, as I have researched it extensivly (and the country is very prominent in the discourse), but I think it'll work as a primer for that also justice in loss and damage is very hard.

# Literature review 10,1/10 pages

Current version:

- Is to hard on the technical solutions critique. It should be more focussed on understanding the actual arguments of the nexus-people
- Should not start with Freire and Chambers, but rather with the mixed-finance and local resilience-building approaches by the world bank. *This is also quite shaky ground, as I might be the only one connecting them*. 

Future version:

- Adaptation nexus. Mainstream development, with a focus on synergies and capacities (everything helps)
- Adaptation regime. Post-development, builds structures for exploitation. 

## Adaptation nexus

Current version:

- Too weak explaination to underpin the argument that mainstream and participatory government has somehow merged. 
- Very long walk-through of theories I am never mentioning again. Should be rewritten with a focus on explaining the concepts behind, rather than the theoretical background.
- Somehow integrate degrees of participation. 

Future version:

- Restructure to have a more chronological flow to it. First the background with participation [@freire1970;@chambers1994] and developmentalism [@geertz2012] as seperate movements, that then slowly turned into a degrees of participation-mush. Then the local turn [@macginty2013;@macginty2015] and the expansion of security [@buur2007;@rothschild1995;@baldwin1997] along ontological and epistemological lines. When climate science developed, this made the whole apparatus naturally come along
- Could say that the climate adaptation plans all have very long sections on participatipon [@rmi2022] and that participation of the "people" is something in all these international frameworks [@lavoine2024;@lawrence2024]. That the international frameworks are somehow locally adapted is often important to them [@ipes-food2018;@diaz2016]
- Add in a discussion of securituzation, that the possible large-scale future suffering [@lenton2023] the fact that the earth is trancending planetary bounderies [@steffen2015;@richardson2023], the conversation (should) shift into another gear, much like what @waever1995 argues.
- Add in a discussion of ecosystem services [@almenar2021;@gret-regamey2012;@woodhead2019;@brander2012;@pascual2023;@lawrence2022], where the link between society and nature is obviously very important, both for local values [@bingen2000;@sen2000] and for global values like biodiversity and climate change (the planetary boundries)
- It is also a fact that states have a bad track record of delivering development outcomes (some will argue this is because they are the reason for it all), and it is natural to try to limit exposure to a foreign culture when doing a project. Appraoches like the logframe [@ortengren2004] (with its value-neutral name) try to limit it all to easily explainable problems (at least to donors) and equally simple solutions. Traffic deaths? Do a workshop! 
- It is also something to be said about NGOs and their relationship to all this [@banks2015]. If they deliver services based on a budget, the difference between a NGO and an agency is minimal, and perhaps just wrong [@kansiime2019]. 

In essence, I want here to argue that what brings the adaptation nexus together, is its belief that the South is how it is  because of a *lack of something*. This something could be provided by the North. 

The original version of participatory development is not this, and that should be highlighted many times. But the techniques (and the name) was too good to pass up for Aidland.

I want the chapter to make an actual good-faith walk-through of their arguments, because they are, in many ways, very convincing. I could have easily written my thesis about how one should plan better trains in Africa, or do a cost-benefit of a rail-line through the Darian Gap. 

## Adaptation regime

Current section:

- Is a little bit early with the future talk. That is for the theory section.
- Good chronoloical walk-through, except that perhaps the climate reductionism [@hulme2008;@hulme2011] should come right at the same time as environmentality [@agrawal2005]. 
- The language is also a bit fluffy. It is too nice. 


Future section:

- Shorten down on the scholars, and rather expand on the concepts.
- Add a section discussing post-development [@demaria2023;@dunlap2025;@escobar1995]
- Governmentality should get its own couple of paragraphs. Could even be interesting to explain the criminality stuff.
- Add a discussion on *Seeing as a state* [@scott1998] and *The will to improve* [@li2007 ] should get a spot. 
- I should also bring back the idea of the stadium tour, as my way of explaining the literature on this kind of work in peace, development and adaptation [@craze2021;@autesserre2014;@mosse2011;@paprocki2018]

In essence, I want to argue that the adaptation regime sees the south as *oppressed by the North*, and thus that the best way of helping is no help at all, since this will re-politize. I really like this argument, because it captures the absurdity of development work when you have tried it, but it really doesn't sound convincing the further away from it one gets.
