This section attempts to build climate adaptation as a case that can be researched. First by establishing it as a part of the UNFCCC system, before reviewing the literature about it.
## Context

The introduction/readers guide presents:

1. What the UNFCCC is
2. Mitigation, its connection to economics
3. Adaptation, its connection to development
4. Loss and damage, its connection to transitional justice

## Climate justice at the UNFCCC

The goal of this section is to explain that the UNFCCC is an international body. That means nations are the parties. 

Then a brief history of the development of it. From kyoto to baku. Present the arguments that everything that is not mitigation is a side-payment. NDCS

Its centrality for both climate work, it is a place to see and be seen by climate scholars and activists. I am going this year. 

Countries are attempting the difficult thing to both achieve as much progress as possible, and to avoid responisbility as much as possible.

Also! Here the view of climate as a series of bathtubs (or dams, depends on your choice of metaphor), where climate change leads to environmental change, which can cause damage. That is not justice.

If climate change is mitigated, the damage will not happen. That is justice

If environmental change is adapted to, the damage will not happen. That is justice

If the damage is compensated. That is justice. 

## Mitigation

Include the part on that mitigation is a quite simple economic problem. 

Each dollar spent is spent on something. 

- Shift spending to less polluting sectors/products - mitigation (through tax/ets-systems)
- Shift spender (from private to public) - mitigation. Recent danish study that it is better for climate if the government taxes and spends money on teachers and nurses, climate emissions are radically
- Spend less - mitigation - This is essencially the degrowth argument

This is an ~~easy~~ solvable political question. 

## Adaptation



## Loss and damage


Include the link to transitional justice. Complicate it with the fact that it is compensations for damage to be done in the future. A kind of wierd "would be sad if anything happened". 


# Literature review

The introduction/readers guide presents:

1. Adaptation nexus
2. Adaptation regime

## Adaptation nexus

Securitization, nexus, positive spiral etc.
