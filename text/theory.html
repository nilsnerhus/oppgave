<p>Climate adaptation discourse serves as a site of contested futures where epistemological and ontological assumptions shape which adaptation pathways are considered possible, legitimate, or desirable, often constraining rather than expanding future possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Climate adaptation planning represents a critical domain where questions of knowledge, power, and possibility intersect. As societies worldwide develop responses to climate change, they necessarily engage with fundamental questions: What counts as valid knowledge about climate vulnerability? Who has the authority to define appropriate responses? Which futures are considered possible or desirable? This chapter develops a theoretical framework for understanding how adaptation discourse might reflect either epistemological diversity—drawing on multiple knowledge systems and worldviews—or epistemological monoculture—converging around singular ways of knowing and responding.</p>
<p>The framework brings together three interconnected bodies of theory that illuminate different dimensions of this question. First, Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s work on “Epistemologies of the South” provides tools for understanding how certain knowledge systems achieve dominance while others are systematically marginalized or rendered non-existent. This perspective reveals adaptation planning as a potential site of epistemicide—where alternative ways of knowing climate, vulnerability, and response are eliminated through frameworks that cannot recognize them as knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, critical futures studies offers insights into how planning processes shape which futures can be imagined and pursued. The work of scholars like Sohail Inayatullah and Tony Fry shows how anticipatory governance doesn’t simply respond to projected futures but actively constructs them, often eliminating alternative possibilities through the very tools meant to enhance future-thinking. This temporal dimension is crucial for understanding adaptation as not just technical planning but as future-making that may enable certain worlds while foreclosing others.</p>
<p>Third, the concept of discourse centralization provides a theoretical bridge between these critical perspectives and empirical analysis. By theorizing how patterns of convergence or divergence in discourse might indicate underlying epistemological dynamics, this framework offers a way to make visible processes that typically remain hidden—the systematic operation of power through seemingly neutral technical processes.</p>
<p>Together, these theoretical lenses reveal adaptation planning as more than responses to environmental change. They illuminate it as a domain where colonial relations may extend into new dimensions, where the possibility of alternative futures is at stake, and where the gap between pluriversal possibilities and singular frameworks becomes consequential. The following sections develop each theoretical component, building toward an integrated framework for analyzing how adaptation discourse reflects deeper struggles over knowledge, time, and possibility.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Adaptation discourse privileges Northern knowledge systems while systematically marginalizing alternative epistemologies, reproducing cognitive injustice despite the diverse contexts in which adaptation occurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A critical starting point for understanding epistemological diversity in climate adaptation is Boaventura de Sousa Santos’ concept of “Epistemologies of the South.” Santos argues that modern Western knowledge production has systematically rendered alternative knowledge systems invisible through what he terms “epistemicide” – the elimination or marginalization of knowledge systems that do not conform to dominant scientific paradigms <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>. This cognitive injustice parallels the material injustices of climate change itself, where those least responsible for emissions often face the greatest impacts while having the least voice in shaping response strategies.</p>
<p>Santos identifies two key problems in dominant knowledge systems: the “epistemological problem” concerning what counts as knowledge and who can produce it, and the “ontological problem” concerning what exists and how we relate to it. Both problems are evident in climate adaptation discourse, where certain forms of expert knowledge (particularly climate science, economics, and engineering) are typically privileged over indigenous, local, and experiential knowledge. This privileging occurs despite growing recognition that addressing complex challenges like climate adaptation requires diverse knowledge systems working in complementarity rather than hierarchy.</p>
<p>The mechanisms through which epistemicide operates extend far beyond direct suppression. Santos identifies five monocultures that structure modern thinking and systematically produce non-existence <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>. The monoculture of knowledge establishes scientific knowledge as the sole criterion of truth, rendering other forms of knowing as ignorance or folklore. The monoculture of linear time positions certain societies as “advanced” and others as “backward,” creating a temporal hierarchy that justifies intervention. The monoculture of social classification naturalizes hierarchies based on race, gender, and class. The monoculture of the dominant scale privileges the global and universal over the local and particular. Finally, the monoculture of capitalist productivity recognizes only what contributes to economic growth as productive, dismissing subsistence practices and reciprocal economies as unproductive. These monocultures manifest across various domains of global governance, revealing systematic patterns of epistemological violence. Structural adjustment programs of the 1980s and 1990s exemplified this process, rendering invisible local economic practices that maintained community resilience through reciprocity, collective labor, and non-monetary exchange. These practices were not merely overlooked but actively reconstructed as obstacles to development, their elimination framed as necessary modernization.</p>
<p>Contemporary biodiversity conservation frameworks similarly exclude indigenous management systems by demanding documentation and quantification in forms these systems never required. Traditional ecological knowledge accumulated over generations through oral tradition and embodied practice cannot be captured in species inventories or ecosystem service valuations, and thus disappears from conservation planning. Poverty reduction strategies provide another revealing example, eliminating alternative conceptions of wellbeing by imposing metrics that recognize only monetary income and formal employment. Communities that maintain rich social relationships, cultural practices, and subsistence security despite low cash incomes are rendered “extremely poor” and targeted for interventions that may actually undermine their wellbeing. In each case, the epistemicide operates not through direct suppression but through frameworks that simply cannot recognize other ways of knowing as knowledge at all.</p>
<p>This systematic exclusion becomes particularly acute in contexts of anticipatory governance, where institutions attempt to manage emerging futures. As Guston notes, anticipatory governance aims to build “a broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible” <span class="citation" data-cites="guston2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-guston2014" role="doc-biblioref">Guston 2014</a>)</span>. Yet whose knowledge constitutes legitimate “inputs” for this future-making process? The emphasis on “knowledge-based technologies” already signals a privileging of technoscientific approaches over other ways of understanding and relating to uncertain futures.</p>
<p>The concept of cognitive justice suggests that there can be no social justice without recognizing the validity and value of diverse ways of knowing. In the context of climate adaptation, cognitive justice would require creating space for multiple knowledge systems to inform how vulnerability is understood and addressed. This does not mean uncritically accepting all knowledge claims as equally valid but rather recognizing that different knowledge systems have different strengths, limitations, and domains of applicability. Scientific knowledge excels at identifying large-scale patterns and projecting future scenarios, but may miss the nuanced understanding of local variability that comes from generations of place-based observation. Indigenous knowledge systems often embed sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships within cultural practices and spiritual frameworks that Western science dismisses as merely cultural.</p>
<p>Santos proposes an “ecology of knowledges” as an alternative to epistemological monocultures. Rather than positioning Western scientific knowledge as inherently superior to other forms of knowledge, an ecology of knowledges recognizes the partial and situated nature of all knowledge systems and seeks productive dialogue between them. This approach aligns with calls from scholars and practitioners for more pluralistic and inclusive approaches to climate adaptation that draw on diverse knowledge systems. However, the challenge lies not merely in including different knowledge but in creating conditions where these different ways of knowing can genuinely shape understanding and action.</p>
<p>The distinction between technocratic and relational ontologies illuminates why certain knowledge systems dominate while others are marginalized. A technocratic ontology frames vulnerability as primarily a technical problem requiring expert solutions, emphasizing quantification, prediction, and control. This perspective positions adaptation as a process of adjusting systems to accommodate projected climate impacts, with technologies and management techniques as primary solutions. Within this framework, valid knowledge is that which can be standardized, measured, and scaled – vulnerability indices, climate projections, cost-benefit ratios.</p>
<p>In contrast, a relational ontology understands vulnerability as embedded in dynamic social-ecological relationships and power dynamics. This perspective emphasizes connectivity, emergence, and transformation, viewing adaptation as a process of reconfiguring relationships between humans and non-humans, present and future generations, and different forms of knowledge. From this standpoint, knowledge is always situated, embodied, and relational – inseparable from the contexts and relationships through which it emerges. The dominance of technocratic ontologies in adaptation discourse reflects broader patterns of knowledge production that privilege certain ways of knowing and being while marginalizing others. This dominance is not politically neutral but shapes which adaptation pathways are considered legitimate or feasible, often reinforcing existing power relations rather than transforming them <span class="citation" data-cites="scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020</a>)</span>. The concept of “provincializing Europe” helps understand what moving beyond epistemological monocultures might entail <span class="citation" data-cites="chakrabarty2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chakrabarty2009" role="doc-biblioref">Chakrabarty 2009</a>)</span>. Rather than accepting European-derived categories as universal, this approach reveals them as particular, historical products that achieved global dominance through colonial violence. The scientific method, the nation-state, development, and now adaptation – all emerge from specific European historical experiences yet are treated as universal frameworks all societies must adopt. Provincializing these concepts does not mean rejecting them entirely but recognizing their particularity and the violence involved in their universalization.</p>
<p>The role of expertise and professional networks in maintaining epistemological monocultures deserves particular attention. As Brinks and Ibert note, expertise is not simply technical knowledge but a social relation involving recognition, authority, and trust <span class="citation" data-cites="brinks2025">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-brinks2025" role="doc-biblioref">Brinks and Donner 2025</a>)</span>. Networks of experts – trained in similar institutions, using similar frameworks, reading similar literatures – create what might be termed epistemological corridors through which certain forms of knowledge flow while others are blocked. These networks operate across scales, from global climate science communities to regional development banks to national planning agencies, creating remarkable consistency in how problems are framed and solutions imagined.</p>
<p>Understanding how epistemicide operates through adaptation planning requires methods that can make visible what is usually invisible – the systematic production of epistemological monoculture. If Santos is correct that certain knowledge systems are actively produced as non-existent, then we should be able to observe this empirically in how adaptation is discussed across different contexts. High convergence in adaptation discourse would indicate successful epistemicide, showing that despite diverse contexts, challenges, and knowledge traditions, only certain ways of knowing can find expression in formal planning processes. This sets the stage for examining how the measurement of discourse patterns can reveal the operation of epistemological power in contemporary climate governance.</p>

<p>Adaptation planning engages in anticipatory governance that actively shapes which futures are considered possible or impossible, with dominant approaches often constraining rather than expanding adaptation possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Climate adaptation is fundamentally oriented toward the future, concerned with anticipating and responding to projected climate impacts. How futures are imagined and constructed through adaptation discourse shapes what interventions are considered necessary, desirable, or even possible. Different approaches to future-making in adaptation reflect different epistemological and ontological assumptions, with significant implications for whose futures are prioritized and how agency is distributed <span class="citation" data-cites="nalau2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-nalau2022" role="doc-biblioref">Nalau and Cobb 2022</a>)</span>. Sohail Inayatullah’s typology of predictive, cultural, and critical epistemologies of the future provides a useful framework for understanding different approaches to future-making in adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="inayatullah1990">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-inayatullah1990" role="doc-biblioref">Inayatullah 1990</a>)</span>. The predictive approach, dominant in mainstream adaptation discourse, relies on scientific forecasting, scenario planning, and risk assessment to anticipate future climate impacts and design appropriate responses. This approach privileges certain forms of expertise, particularly climate science, economics, and engineering, and tends to frame the future primarily in terms of biophysical changes and their direct consequences.</p>
<p>While valuable for identifying potential risks and intervention points, the predictive approach often inadequately addresses the social, cultural, and political dimensions of climate futures. It may present particular development pathways as inevitable rather than as choices shaped by values and power relations. Moreover, by positioning experts as the primary authorities on the future, predictive approaches may marginalize the future visions and aspirations of communities most affected by climate impacts <span class="citation" data-cites="goode2017">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-goode2017" role="doc-biblioref">Goode and Godhe 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The cultural approach to futures emphasizes how different cultural contexts produce different understandings of time, change, and desirable futures. This approach recognizes that how communities imagine and relate to the future is shaped by cultural values, traditions, and worldviews that may differ significantly from dominant Western frameworks <span class="citation" data-cites="inayatullah1990">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-inayatullah1990" role="doc-biblioref">Inayatullah 1990</a>)</span>. Indigenous cosmologies, for instance, often emphasize cyclical rather than linear time, relationships with ancestors and future generations, and responsibilities to non-human beings – all of which generate different orientations toward the future than those embedded in Western planning frameworks.</p>
<p>The critical approach to futures focuses on examining and challenging the assumptions, power relations, and interests embedded in dominant future visions. This approach seeks to “denaturalize” seemingly inevitable futures by revealing how they are constructed through particular discourses and practices <span class="citation" data-cites="inayatullah1990">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-inayatullah1990" role="doc-biblioref">Inayatullah 1990</a>)</span>. In adaptation, a critical approach might interrogate whose interests are served by particular adaptation pathways, how vulnerability is constructed through adaptation discourse, and what alternative futures are rendered invisible or implausible by dominant approaches.</p>
<p>The dominance of predictive epistemologies in global governance connects to what Goode and Godhe identify as “capitalist realism” – the sense that capitalist social relations are natural and inevitable, constraining imagination of alternative futures <span class="citation" data-cites="goode2017">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-goode2017" role="doc-biblioref">Goode and Godhe 2017</a>)</span>. When adaptation is framed primarily within existing capitalist relations and market logics, alternatives that might challenge these relations become difficult to imagine or articulate. This narrowing of future possibilities reflects broader patterns of what might be termed anticipatory enclosure, where the future is colonized by present power relations before it arrives.</p>
<p>The concept of anticipatory governance illuminates both the promise and peril of future-oriented planning. Guston defines anticipatory governance as building capacities for “foresight, engagement, and integration” to manage emerging challenges <span class="citation" data-cites="guston2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-guston2014" role="doc-biblioref">Guston 2014</a>)</span>. In principle, this forward-looking orientation could create space for diverse communities to shape their own futures. In practice, however, anticipatory governance often operates through specific institutional arrangements, expert networks, and knowledge frameworks that privilege certain futures while foreclosing others.</p>
<p>This brings us to the crucial concept of “defuturing” developed by Tony Fry. Defuturing refers to the systematic destruction of futures – not through catastrophic events but through the mundane operation of design decisions, planning processes, and institutional arrangements that eliminate possibilities before they can emerge <span class="citation" data-cites="fry2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-fry2019" role="doc-biblioref">Fry 2019</a>)</span>. Fry argues that modern design and planning are fundamentally defuturing, creating unsustainable systems that consume the future to maintain the present. In the context of global governance, defuturing operates through frameworks that can only recognize certain kinds of futures as valid or feasible.</p>
<p>The tools and methods of future-making play a crucial role in this defuturing process. Scenario planning exercises, for instance, typically begin from current trajectories and project forward, making it difficult to imagine radical discontinuities or alternative development paths. Vulnerability assessments focus on exposure to physical hazards within existing social arrangements rather than questioning those arrangements. Cost-benefit analyses discount future impacts in ways that systematically undervalue long-term transformation in favor of short-term adjustment. Each of these tools shapes not just how the future is known but what futures can be imagined <span class="citation" data-cites="fry2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-fry2019" role="doc-biblioref">Fry 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Ivan Illich’s analysis of tools provides another lens for understanding how future-making operates in governance contexts. Illich distinguishes between tools that enhance capability and those that create dependency, arguing that many modern tools – despite appearing to expand human capacities – actually constrain autonomy and imagination <span class="citation" data-cites="illich2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-illich2009" role="doc-biblioref">Illich 2009</a>)</span>. In adaptation planning, the proliferation of assessment tools, modeling frameworks, and planning templates might be understood as creating what Illich terms “radical monopoly” – not just monopoly over products but over processes of imagination and response.</p>
<p>The consultants who carry these tools between contexts become what Illich might recognize as “disabling professionals” – experts whose specialized knowledge creates dependencies rather than building local capacities <span class="citation" data-cites="illich2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-illich2009" role="doc-biblioref">Illich 2009</a>)</span>. A consultant arrives with frameworks developed in one context and applies them in another, shaping how local actors must articulate their understanding of vulnerability and their visions for adaptation. Communities learn to see their own futures through these imported lenses, potentially losing connection with their own ways of anticipating and preparing for change.</p>
<p>This process connects to what Walter Mignolo identifies as the coloniality of knowledge and being – the ways colonial power relations extend into the present through knowledge systems and subjectivities <span class="citation" data-cites="mignolo2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mignolo2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mignolo 2011</a>)</span>. But Mignolo’s analysis points toward something even more profound: the colonization of time itself. The “colonial matrix of power” doesn’t just operate in space but extends into the temporal dimension, shaping which pasts can be remembered and which futures can be imagined. This temporal colonialism manifests in multiple ways through planning processes. Linear progress narratives position certain societies as “advanced” and others as needing to “catch up,” reproducing colonial hierarchies through temporal framing. Predictive models typically assume that current development trajectories will continue, making it difficult to imagine alternative pathways that might emerge from different values or social arrangements. Financial mechanisms like loans and climate funds create temporal dependencies, locking countries into particular development paths to service debts or meet donor requirements. Planning horizons privilege certain temporal scales – often the medium-term relevant to political and funding cycles – while marginalizing both immediate needs and long-term transformations <span class="citation" data-cites="mignolo2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mignolo2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mignolo 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Kyle Whyte’s concept of “relational tipping points” adds another crucial dimension to understanding temporal colonialism in environmental governance. While much attention focuses on ecological tipping points – thresholds beyond which environmental systems shift to new states – Whyte argues that relational tipping points may be crossed first <span class="citation" data-cites="whyte2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2020" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte 2020</a>)</span>. These are points beyond which the relationships necessary for collective action are too damaged to enable coordinated response. For indigenous peoples facing climate change, centuries of colonial violence have already damaged the trust, reciprocity, and mutual recognition needed for collaborative adaptation. The time required to rebuild these relationships may exceed the time available before ecological crises <span class="citation" data-cites="whyte2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2020" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This analysis connects directly to the concept of “anticipatory ruination” developed in studies of climate adaptation. Paprocki shows how certain places are rendered as already lost to climate change, justifying radical interventions in the present <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2019" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2019</a>)</span>. This is not simply prediction but performative – by imagining certain futures as inevitable, planning processes help bring them into being. When coastal communities are designated as future flood zones, investment shifts away, infrastructure deteriorates, and outmigration accelerates, creating the abandonment that was supposedly being prevented. The implications of understanding future-making as a site of power and potential violence are profound. If planning processes actively defuture – eliminating possible worlds before they can emerge – then the stakes of adaptation governance exceed technical questions of risk management. The issue becomes not just which adaptations are chosen but which futures are allowed to exist. This is particularly critical for communities whose ways of life, knowledge systems, and relationships with land and water are rendered impossible by planning processes that can only recognize certain kinds of futures.</p>
<p>Critical futures studies offers resources for challenging these patterns of defuturing. As Goode and Godhe argue, the task is not simply to predict probable futures or envision preferable ones, but to critically examine how futures are produced, whose interests they serve, and what possibilities they foreclose <span class="citation" data-cites="goode2017">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-goode2017" role="doc-biblioref">Goode and Godhe 2017</a>)</span>. This critical orientation opens space for what might be termed “re-futuring” – actively creating conditions for multiple futures to flourish rather than converging on a single trajectory determined by current power relations.</p>
<p>The concept of “pluriversal futures” emerging from Latin American scholarship offers one vision of what re-futuring might entail. Rather than a single future toward which all societies converge, this approach imagines multiple temporal trajectories emerging from different ontologies and ways of life <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2020" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2020</a>)</span>. These are not simply different paths to the same destination but genuinely different worlds with their own temporal rhythms, relationships, and possibilities. Supporting such pluriversal futures requires more than inclusive planning – it requires recognizing that different peoples may inhabit fundamentally different temporal worlds.</p>
<p>Understanding future-making as a contested terrain of power reveals adaptation planning as more than technical response to environmental change. It emerges as a site where colonial relations extend into the temporal dimension, where certain futures are enabled while others are foreclosed, where the very possibility of alternative worlds is at stake. This brings us to the question of how we might empirically observe these processes of defuturing – how discourse patterns might reveal the systematic elimination of alternative futures. The concept of discourse centralization offers one approach to making visible what is often hidden: the successful reduction of pluriversal possibilities to singular trajectories.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The concept of discourse centralization provides a theoretical framework for analyzing how adaptation discourse reflects either epistemological diversity or monoculture across different contexts and dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theoretical tensions between epistemological diversity and monoculture, while conceptually rich, require empirical grounding to move beyond assertion and critique. Discourse centralization represents the degree to which adaptation planning documents concentrate their attention on a limited set of themes versus distributing attention across many diverse topics. In a highly centralized discourse, most documents emphasize the same few topics, suggesting a convergence around particular ways of understanding and addressing adaptation. Conversely, a decentralized discourse would show documents emphasizing different combinations of topics, indicating greater diversity in how adaptation challenges and responses are conceptualized. This pattern of concentration or dispersion serves as a proxy for epistemological diversity—the range of knowledge systems, values, and worldviews that inform adaptation planning.</p>
<p>The significance of measuring discourse centralization lies in what it reveals about the constraints and possibilities within adaptation planning. When discourse is highly centralized, it suggests that despite the diverse contexts in which adaptation occurs—from small island states facing sea-level rise to landlocked countries confronting desertification—there is a remarkable uniformity in how these challenges are understood and articulated. This uniformity might reflect the influence of international frameworks, funding requirements, or technical assistance that promote particular approaches. Alternatively, decentralized discourse would indicate space for diverse conceptualizations that might draw on local knowledge, alternative development paradigms, or context-specific understandings of vulnerability and resilience.</p>
<p>Drawing on Santos’s concept of abyssal thinking, discourse centralization can be understood as an empirical manifestation of how certain knowledge comes to exist “on this side of the line” while other knowledge is actively produced as non-existent <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>. The line Santos describes is not merely a boundary but an active process of differentiation that grants reality to some forms of knowledge while denying it to others. High discourse centralization would indicate that this abyssal line operates effectively—that despite the diversity of contexts, challenges, and knowledge traditions present in different countries, only knowledge from “this side” can find expression in formal planning documents. This connects to Santos’s analysis of how the five monocultures produce non-existence. When adaptation documents across diverse contexts converge on similar topics—financial mechanisms, institutional arrangements, technical assessments—we observe the monoculture of knowledge in operation, where only certain forms of expertise are recognized as valid. When these documents frame adaptation primarily in terms of future projections and linear progress, we see the monoculture of linear time eliminating other temporal orientations. The measurement of centralization thus becomes a way to observe empirically what Santos argues occurs epistemologically—the active production of non-existence through frameworks that cannot recognize alternative ways of knowing <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The relationship between discourse patterns and epistemological diversity is not one of simple correspondence but of indication and revelation. High centralization does not cause epistemicide but indicates its successful operation. When countries facing fundamentally different environmental challenges produce remarkably similar planning documents, this suggests that the frameworks through which they must articulate their understanding are powerfully constraining. The convergence reveals not what these countries think about adaptation but what they must say to participate in international climate governance.</p>
<p>This distinction is crucial for understanding discourse centralization as more than a linguistic phenomenon. The patterns we observe in texts are materializations of deeper epistemological and political processes. When a Pacific island nation and a landlocked African country produce similar adaptation plans focused on institutional capacity and financial mechanisms, this similarity does not reflect shared understanding but shared subjection to frameworks that can only recognize certain kinds of knowledge and certain ways of articulating need.</p>
<p>Arturo Escobar’s concept of the pluriverse provides another theoretical lens for understanding what discourse centralization reveals <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>. Escobar contrasts the “one-world world” (OWW) of modernity—which assumes a single reality that can be known through universal science—with the pluriverse, “a world where many worlds fit.” The pluriverse is not simply cultural diversity within a single world but recognition of multiple ontologies, multiple ways of being and knowing that create genuinely different worlds.</p>
<p>From this perspective, high discourse centralization indicates the successful imposition of the one-world world over pluriversal possibilities. When adaptation planning can only recognize certain forms of vulnerability (those measurable through indices), certain temporalities (linear projections), and certain responses (technical interventions), it actively eliminates other worlds where vulnerability might be understood relationally, time might be cyclical, and responses might involve ceremony, reciprocity, or transformation of social relations. The degree of centralization thus becomes a measure of how successfully the one-world world has eliminated pluriversal possibilities <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This framework helps distinguish between superficial diversity and genuine epistemological plurality. Documents might vary in their specific content—mentioning different crops, infrastructures, or hazards—while converging at a deeper epistemological level in how they understand the nature of climate challenge and appropriate response. Conversely, even similar-sounding content might emerge from fundamentally different epistemological groundings. The measurement of discourse centralization attempts to capture these deeper patterns rather than surface variations.</p>
<p>The theoretical significance of this approach extends beyond description to revelation. By making discourse patterns visible and measurable, we can observe processes that typically remain hidden. Epistemicide does not announce itself—it operates through the quiet violence of bureaucratic forms, funding criteria, and technical requirements that seem neutral while systematically excluding alternative ways of knowing. The measurement of centralization makes this violence visible by showing its effects: the remarkable convergence of discourse despite diverse contexts.</p>
<p>This connects to Fry’s concept of defuturing, but at an epistemological level <span class="citation" data-cites="fry2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-fry2019" role="doc-biblioref">Fry 2019</a>)</span>. Just as defuturing eliminates possible worlds before they can emerge, epistemological centralization eliminates possible ways of knowing and articulating before they can find expression. The measurement of discourse patterns reveals not just what is said but what has become unsayable—the alternatives that have been successfully eliminated from the realm of formal articulation.</p>
<p>The approach differs fundamentally from simply noting similarities across documents or conducting comparative analysis. Rather than asking “how are these documents similar or different,” the centralization framework asks “what does the pattern of similarity and difference reveal about the operation of epistemological power?” The interest is not in cataloging convergences but in understanding what these convergences indicate about which knowledge systems can find expression and which are systematically excluded.</p>
<p>This theoretical framing establishes why computational approaches like topic modeling offer valuable tools for critical analysis. These methods can process large corpora of documents to identify patterns that might not be visible through close reading of individual texts. More importantly, they can quantify the degree of convergence in ways that make abstract concepts like epistemicide empirically tractable. The patterns revealed through such analysis do not speak for themselves but require theoretical interpretation informed by critical perspectives on knowledge, power, and possibility.</p>
<p>The measurement of discourse centralization also connects to broader methodological discussions in decolonial research. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith argues, research methodologies themselves can be tools of colonization, imposing external frameworks and extracting knowledge in ways that reinforce colonial relations <span class="citation" data-cites="smith2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-smith2022" role="doc-biblioref">Smith 2022</a>)</span>. The approach to measuring centralization must therefore be reflexive about its own epistemological assumptions and political implications. The goal is not to impose another universal framework but to develop tools that can reveal the operation of universalizing frameworks.</p>
<p>This brings us to a crucial distinction between centralization as homogenization and centralization as domination. Simple homogeneity might result from shared challenges or convergent evolution of responses. But when homogeneity occurs despite radically different contexts and in ways that systematically exclude certain forms of knowledge, it indicates domination—the successful imposition of particular epistemological frameworks over others. The theoretical framework of discourse centralization aims to distinguish between these possibilities.</p>
<p>The implications of high centralization extend beyond academic analysis to questions of justice and possibility. If adaptation planning operates to systematically exclude alternative ways of knowing and being, then it functions not as a response to climate change but as a mechanism for maintaining colonial relations through new vocabularies. The measurement of centralization provides one way to make this operation visible and thus contestable.</p>
<p>Understanding discourse centralization as an indicator of epistemological monoculture also suggests possibilities for resistance and transformation. If we can identify where and how alternative epistemologies are excluded, we might also identify spaces where they persist or could flourish. Lower centralization might indicate cracks in the system—places where the one-world world has not fully succeeded in eliminating alternatives. These spaces, however marginal, might offer starting points for nurturing epistemological diversity.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework of discourse centralization thus serves multiple purposes. It provides a bridge between abstract concepts like epistemicide and empirical analysis. It offers a way to observe processes that typically remain hidden. It reveals the operation of power through knowledge frameworks that appear neutral. Most fundamentally, it makes visible the gap between the pluriversal possibilities that exist in the world and the singular framework that dominates formal planning processes. This visibility is a necessary first step toward creating conditions where many worlds might flourish rather than being reduced to one.</p>
<p>This theoretical grounding establishes the foundation for empirical investigation. If discourse centralization indicates epistemological monoculture, then measuring centralization across different contexts can reveal how successfully dominant frameworks have eliminated alternatives. The patterns observed—whether high or low centralization, whether varying by region, income, or geography—become legible as indicators of epistemological power in operation. This sets the stage for developing methodological approaches that can capture these patterns while remaining attentive to what they reveal about knowledge, power, and the possibility of alternative futures in climate governance.</p>
