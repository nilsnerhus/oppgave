<p>The literature on climate adaptation is divided between the adaptation nexus approach that emphasizes technical solutions within existing systems and the adaptation regime critique that views adaptation discourse as a technique of power reinforcing rather than challenging global inequalities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, this section presents the two main strands of climate adaptation research. One is sympathetic, the adaptation nexus, while the other is critical, the adaptation regime. Climate adaptation is concerned with vulnerability to climate damages, and the main disagreement is in the production of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The literature in this field maps onto broader debates in development studies, where the study of interventions in other societies has a long theoretical history. These competing paradigms reveal fundamentally different understandings of what adaptation is, how vulnerability is produced, and consequently, what appropriate interventions look like.</p>
<p>The adaptation nexus approach builds on conceptual foundations in participatory development, drawing from the work of scholars like Chambers and Freire. It focuses on assets, endowments, and capabilities as articulated by Sen, employing analytical frameworks such as sustainable livelihoods and vulnerability assessments. Methodologically, this approach favors participatory rural appraisal and knowledge co-production. Key institutional supporters include UNDP and the World Bank, which promote synergistic sector approaches that seek to address multiple development challenges simultaneously through adaptation interventions <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2010">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the adaptation regime paradigm emerges from post-structural critiques of development by scholars such as Escobar and Ferguson. It introduces key concepts like environmentality <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal 2005</a>)</span> and the adaptation regime <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2018</a>)</span>, critically analyzing adaptation discourse as a technique of power. This paradigm employs ethnographic and discourse analysis methods, drawing extensively on case studies from Bangladesh and other climate “hotspots” to illustrate how adaptation can function as mere “spice” for conventional development projects, leading to maladaptation that may exacerbate vulnerability <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The adaptation nexus approach builds on development traditions to frame adaptation as a technical challenge requiring synergistic sector interventions, emphasizing assets, capabilities, and institutional adjustments within existing systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adaptation nexus approach has its roots in participatory movements in the 1990s, critiquing the then paradigm of top-down development research and practice, preoccupied with governmental institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="freire1970 chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-freire1970" role="doc-biblioref">Freire 1970</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers 1994</a>)</span>. The participatory turn emerged as a response to decades of failed development interventions that imposed external solutions without understanding local contexts or incorporating local knowledge. Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy emphasized dialogue and conscientization as alternatives to what he termed the “banking model” of education and development, where experts simply deposited knowledge into supposedly empty vessels <span class="citation" data-cites="freire1970">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-freire1970" role="doc-biblioref">Freire 1970</a>)</span>. Robert Chambers similarly challenged development professionals to examine their biases and recognize the value of local expertise, famously advocating for “putting the last first” <span class="citation" data-cites="chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers 1994</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The researcher was not to observe and report, but had the ethical responsibility to include and empower the communities they researched <span class="citation" data-cites="desai2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-desai2006" role="doc-biblioref">Desai and Potter 2006</a>)</span>. This ethical reorientation reflected broader epistemological shifts in development studies, recognizing multiple ways of knowing and the value of situated knowledge. Researchers were encouraged to view themselves as facilitators rather than experts, working alongside communities to co-produce knowledge rather than extracting data for academic purposes.</p>
<p>New methods were developed to better map communities and engage them in knowledge production, such as participatory rural appraisal. These methodologies included techniques like transect walks, community mapping, seasonal calendars, and wealth ranking exercises that enabled communities to visualize and analyze their own situations <span class="citation" data-cites="chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers 1994</a>)</span>. Unlike conventional survey techniques that often reinforced power differentials, these approaches were designed to be accessible to non-literate participants and to foster collective analysis.</p>
<p>The data collected was used with new analytical framework centering the individual and communities. These frameworks analyzed how livelihoods were stitched together with a mix of assets, endowments, capabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="sen2000">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-sen2000" role="doc-biblioref">Sen 2000</a>)</span>, shaped by access <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2003">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2003" role="doc-biblioref">J. C. Ribot and Peluso 2003</a>)</span> and aspirations <span class="citation" data-cites="appadurai2004">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-appadurai2004" role="doc-biblioref">Appadurai 2004</a>)</span>, amongst others.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach similarly shifted focus from resources or income to what people can actually do and be with those resources <span class="citation" data-cites="sen2000">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-sen2000" role="doc-biblioref">Sen 2000</a>)</span>. By emphasizing capabilities rather than commodities, this framework highlighted how the same resources might translate into very different outcomes depending on various conversion factors, including personal characteristics, social arrangements, and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Jesse Ribot’s theory of access complemented these frameworks by examining the mechanisms through which people gain, control, and maintain access to resources <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2003">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2003" role="doc-biblioref">J. C. Ribot and Peluso 2003</a>)</span>. This approach went beyond formal property rights to consider how access is shaped by technology, capital, markets, labor, knowledge, authority, identity, and social relations. By highlighting these multiple mechanisms, Ribot’s work helped explain why formal rights often fail to translate into actual benefits for marginalized groups and how power operates in resource governance.</p>
<p>This gave valuable insight into how societies functioned, and sparked new forms of interventions, with a focus on co-management and knowledge transfer. Community-based natural resource management emerged as one application of these insights, based on the premise that local users with secure rights over resources would manage them more sustainably than distant state authorities <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal 2005</a>)</span>. Co-management approaches similarly sought to establish partnerships between local communities and state or non-state actors in resource governance, recognizing that neither complete centralization nor complete decentralization was optimal in most contexts.</p>
<p>These approaches were not without criticism. Some scholars argued that participatory methods could be co-opted by powerful actors, reinforcing rather than challenging existing power structures. Others noted that an uncritical focus on “the local” might romanticize communities and obscure internal divisions along lines of gender, class, caste, or age. Nevertheless, these frameworks and approaches represented an important shift in development thinking toward more contextually sensitive and participatory approaches.</p>
<p>This strand of research has since become a part of the mainstream development discourse, and variations on the participatory methods being implemented by the largest aid organizations like the World Bank. The World Bank’s adoption of “community-driven development” approaches in the early 2000s represented a significant institutionalization of participatory methods, with billions of dollars channeled through programs emphasizing community control over planning decisions and resources. Similarly, the United Nations Development Programme incorporated community-based adaptation into its climate programming, emphasizing local knowledge and decision-making while providing technical and financial support <span class="citation" data-cites="ensor2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ensor2009" role="doc-biblioref">Ensor and Berger 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>They see climate adaptation as just one policy area amongst all the others, and is searching for some key sectors and for synergies between them <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2010">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland 2010</a>)</span>. This “mainstreaming” approach seeks to incorporate adaptation considerations into existing development planning and sectoral policies rather than treating adaptation as a standalone issue. Proponents argue that mainstreaming promotes efficiency, sustainability, and coherence across different policy domains. Key sectors typically identified for adaptation mainstreaming include agriculture, water management, health, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The search for synergies between adaptation and other policy objectives has been particularly prominent in discussions of “co-benefits,” where interventions simultaneously advance adaptation goals while yielding benefits in areas such as mitigation, biodiversity conservation, or poverty reduction <span class="citation" data-cites="almenar2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-almenar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Almenar et al. 2021</a>)</span>. This emphasis on multiple benefits aligns with the efficiency logic of mainstream development institutions and responds to the reality of limited resources for addressing multiple challenges.</p>
<p>One example of this could be tree planting projects, that while their main purpose is carbon sequestration, the project could contribute in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic security through the sale of forest carbon credits to the global north. If the tree is planted as a part of a farming system as a form agroforestry, the wood could be seen as a form of long-term investment that could be harvested in 30 years</li>
<li>Food security through production of fruit</li>
<li>Gender equality by giving the responsibility for managing the trees to women</li>
<li>Environmental security by providing shade with leaves and reduce soil erosion with roots <span class="citation" data-cites="almenar2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-almenar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Almenar et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example illustrates the nexus approach’s emphasis on finding interventions that address multiple objectives simultaneously. By framing tree planting as contributing to climate mitigation, adaptation, economic development, gender equality, and environmental protection, proponents can appeal to diverse stakeholders and funding sources. Similar multi-purpose framings can be found in integrated water resource management, climate-smart agriculture, and ecosystem-based adaptation.</p>
<p>The nexus understanding sees vulnerability as an individual’s <em>lack</em> of certain skill, capability, or access to a resource. When the right resource is given, it is expected to start an upwards spiral, where outcomes will improve in all other fields as well <span class="citation" data-cites="schipper2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-schipper2020" role="doc-biblioref">Schipper 2020</a>)</span>. This conceptualization of vulnerability focuses on characteristics of individuals or communities that make them susceptible to harm, such as limited assets, poor infrastructure, or weak institutions. It tends to frame vulnerability as a condition rather than a process, emphasizing what people lack rather than examining how and why they came to lack these resources or capabilities.</p>
<p>This framing has been criticized for its tendency to depoliticize vulnerability by focusing on technical solutions without addressing the structural factors that create vulnerability in the first place. Critics argue that by framing vulnerability as primarily a problem of individual or community capacity, the nexus approach may inadvertently place responsibility for adaptation on those with the least resources and power to transform the systems that produce vulnerability <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emphasis on synergies and win-win solutions may obscure difficult trade-offs and competing interests that are inherent in adaptation decision-making. Not all stakeholders will benefit equally from particular adaptation interventions, and some may even be harmed. The nexus approach’s tendency to emphasize positive synergies may inadequately prepare practitioners for navigating these difficult trade-offs and power dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2013" role="doc-biblioref">J. Ribot 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite these critiques, the adaptation nexus approach remains highly influential in both research and practice, particularly among major development institutions and funding agencies. Its practical orientation, compatibility with existing institutional structures, and promise of addressing multiple objectives simultaneously contribute to its continued dominance in mainstream adaptation discourse.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The adaptation regime critique draws from post-structural analysis to reveal how adaptation discourse functions as a technique of power that constructs vulnerability in ways that legitimize conventional development interventions while foreclosing alternative futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adaptation regime has its roots in the deconstructionist anthropology of development <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-lewis2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis and Mosse 2006</a>)</span>. It is heavily influenced by post-structuralism, and critiques of the <em>discourse of development</em>. The discourse is analyzed as “a system of knowledge practices, technologies, and power relationships” that orders the relationships between people and institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-lewis2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis and Mosse 2006, 4</a>)</span>. This approach draws from post-structural theory, particularly concepts of discourse, governmentality, and biopolitics, to analyze how power operates through knowledge production and institutional practices.</p>
<p>Central to this perspective is the understanding of discourse not simply as language but as a system that structures what can be thought, said, and done in a particular domain. Discourses establish “regimes of truth” that determine what counts as valid knowledge and who is authorized to speak it. From this perspective, development discourse constructs its objects (underdevelopment, poverty, vulnerability) in ways that simultaneously create the need for intervention and position certain actors (experts, development institutions) as uniquely qualified to intervene <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The discourses that order the relationships between rich and poor countries change over time, and development had replaced civilization, just as civilization had replaced God before it <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Escobar traced how development discourse constructed the “Third World” as an object of knowledge and intervention, establishing relationships of power between experts and those to be “developed” <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>. He documented how development institutions, from the World Bank to bilateral aid agencies to NGOs, produce and disseminate knowledge about developing countries that reinforces certain ways of seeing and intervening while marginalizing others. This knowledge production constitutes a form of power that shapes what interventions are considered legitimate, what outcomes are valued, and whose expertise counts.</p>
<p>Ferguson’s ethnographic study of development in Lesotho demonstrated how development interventions, even when failing to achieve their stated objectives, successfully expand bureaucratic state power and depoliticize poverty by rendering it a technical problem rather than a political one <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>)</span>. His concept of the “anti-politics machine” highlights how development discourse systematically represents poverty and underdevelopment as technical problems requiring technical solutions, effectively sidelining questions of politics, power, and structural inequality. By framing complex political-economic realities as technical challenges amenable to expert intervention, development discourse limits the space for radical alternatives and reinforces existing power relations.</p>
<p>Rather than seeking better development, post-development scholars called for alternatives to development—approaches that break with the epistemological and institutional frameworks of conventional development and create space for diverse ways of knowing and being <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>. This perspective emphasized the importance of local, indigenous, and non-Western knowledge systems and practices that had been marginalized by dominant development discourse.</p>
<p>As nature and climate discourses grew to prominence, <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">Agrawal (<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> argued that the new relationships should be understood as a form of <em>environmentality</em>. Adapting Foucault’s concept of governmentality to environmental contexts, Agrawal examined how environmental governance regimes produce new kinds of environmental subjects who come to care about and act toward the environment in new ways. His ethnographic study of forest councils in Kumaon, India, demonstrated how participation in new regulatory regimes transformed local residents’ subjectivities and relationships to forest resources over time.</p>
<p>This concept of environmentality provided a theoretical bridge between Foucauldian analyses of development and emerging critiques of environmental governance. It highlighted how environmental interventions, like development projects, operate not simply through coercion but through reshaping how people understand themselves and their relationships to the natural world. This perspective is particularly relevant for understanding climate adaptation, which often involves similar processes of knowledge production, subject formation, and governance at multiple scales <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal 2005</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">Paprocki (<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> describes it as an <em>Adaptation regime</em> based on her field work in Bangladesh. She argues that some countries are constructed as climate vulnerable and therefore in need of climate adaptation and that this imaginary is closely related to other historical processes of colonialism. Through careful ethnographic work in coastal Bangladesh, Paprocki documents how a diverse set of actors, including government officials, NGO workers, scientists, and donor agency representatives, collectively produce knowledge about climate vulnerability that justifies particular kinds of interventions while foreclosing others.</p>
<p>This production of Bangladesh as the “ground zero” of climate change operates through what Paprocki terms “anticipatory ruination”—the rendering of certain places as already lost, which justifies radical interventions that might otherwise face resistance. This discursive production of climate vulnerability is not politically neutral but aligned with particular development visions that privilege urbanization, export-oriented growth, and market-based solutions over rural livelihoods and communities <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>All societal issues are reduced to be climate related, and unavoidable<span class="citation" data-cites="hulme2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hulme2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hulme 2011</a>)</span>. This dystopian imaginary builds the groundwork for extensive experimentation, since the dystopian outlook eliminates the possible downsides. This “climate reductionism” transforms complex social, economic, and political challenges into technical problems of climate vulnerability, effectively depoliticizing issues like poverty, inequality, and land rights. By framing climate impacts as inevitable and beyond human control, the adaptation regime eliminates the space for questioning whether particular interventions are necessary or desirable, or whose interests they serve <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This, she argues, leads to dispossession as land is taken for shrimp aquaculture and migration to the cities is promoted. The poor and vulnerable that were supposed to be helped, simply are not <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2018</a>)</span>. Paprocki documents how adaptation interventions in coastal Bangladesh have facilitated a transition from rice farming to export-oriented shrimp aquaculture, displacing smallholder farmers and agricultural laborers. This dispossession is justified in the name of climate adaptation, with shrimp farming presented as more viable in a climate-changed future despite its negative social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">Dewan (<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> further develops this, highlighting the building of dams and polders as flood protection. She argues the polders built as a climate adaptation measure, are the same as the old for flood protection, and are successful at acquiring funding. Climate adaptation was <em>the spice</em> that made their applications for funding work. The only issue was that the polders did not work. By blocking the seasonal flooding and draining, the rivers became silted and needed dredging, furthering the risk of floods.</p>
<p>Dewan’s analysis illustrates how the adaptation regime recycles old development interventions under new climate adaptation labels. Polders (embankments designed to protect low-lying land from flooding) had been constructed in Bangladesh since the 1960s, with mixed results. Yet rather than learning from these experiences, similar interventions were repackaged as climate adaptation to access new funding streams. This “adaptation as spice” phenomenon reveals how the climate adaptation label is used to legitimize and secure funding for interventions that might otherwise face scrutiny or resistance <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dewan shows how these interventions often fail on their own terms, creating new vulnerabilities rather than reducing existing ones. By disrupting natural hydrological processes, the polders contributed to river siltation, waterlogging, and increased flood risk—precisely the problems they were supposed to address. This pattern of maladaptation highlights the limits of technical approaches that fail to engage with complex social-ecological systems and the knowledge of those who inhabit them <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptation regime critique extends beyond Bangladesh to other contexts where similar dynamics operate. In the Pacific, scholars have documented how the construction of small island states as inevitably disappearing due to sea level rise has justified interventions focused on migration rather than supporting communities’ desires to remain and adapt in place. This “drowning islands” discourse constructs Pacific Islanders primarily as future climate refugees, obscuring their agency, resilience, and ongoing adaptation efforts. It also shifts attention from the responsibilities of high-emitting countries to reduce emissions to the supposed inevitability of displacement <span class="citation" data-cites="janzen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-janzen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Janzen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Across diverse contexts, similar patterns emerge of vulnerability being constructed in ways that align with existing development paradigms rather than challenging them. Adaptation interventions reproduce rather than transform the political-economic relations that generate vulnerability in the first place. The adaptation regime operates not through simple imposition but through the production of knowledge, subjects, and governance arrangements that make particular approaches seem natural, necessary, and inevitable.</p>
<p>Critics have also examined the role of visualization technologies and media representations in producing the adaptation regime’s dystopian imaginaries. Climate models, vulnerability maps, and disaster photography together constitute seemingly objective perspectives that mask their partial and situated nature. These visual technologies produce certain places and populations as exceptionally vulnerable, justifying interventions by external experts while often marginalizing local understandings of environmental change and appropriate responses <span class="citation" data-cites="scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptation regime critique does not deny the reality of climate impacts or the need for adaptation. Rather, it questions who defines what adaptation means, whose knowledge counts in designing interventions, and who benefits from adaptation funding. It calls attention to how adaptation discourses and practices can reproduce rather than challenge existing power relations, and how they may foreclose alternative futures that do not align with dominant development paradigms <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2013" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland and McKinnon 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This critical perspective has begun to influence adaptation practice, with growing attention to questions of justice, transformation, and alternative knowledge systems. Some scholars and practitioners are exploring how adaptation might be reimagined as a site of contestation and possibility rather than technical management—a space where communities can articulate and pursue their own visions of climate-just futures. These approaches emphasize the political nature of adaptation decisions and seek to democratize adaptation governance in ways that center the agency and knowledge of those most affected by climate impacts <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps most fundamentally, the adaptation regime critique challenges us to rethink what counts as adaptation and who gets to decide. It suggests that true adaptation may require transforming the social, economic, and political systems that produce vulnerability in the first place, rather than simply adjusting to their outcomes. This may involve reimagining and reconfiguring relationships between humans and non-humans, between present and future generations, and between different ways of knowing and being in the world <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
