<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The literature on climate adaptation is divided between the adaptation nexus approach that emphasizes technical solutions within existing systems and the adaptation regime critique that views adaptation discourse as a technique of power reinforcing rather than challenging global inequalities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, this section presents the two main strands of climate adaptation research. One is sympathetic, the adaptation nexus, while the other is critical, the adaptation regime. Climate adaptation is concerned with vulnerability to climate damages, and the main disagreement is in the production of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The literature in this field maps onto broader debates in development studies, where the study of interventions in other societies has a long theoretical history. These competing paradigms reveal fundamentally different understandings of what adaptation is, how vulnerability is produced, and consequently, what appropriate interventions look like.</p>
<p>The adaptation nexus approach builds on conceptual foundations in participatory development, drawing from the work of scholars like Chambers and Freire. It focuses on assets, endowments, and capabilities as articulated by Sen, employing analytical frameworks such as sustainable livelihoods and vulnerability assessments. Methodologically, this approach favors participatory rural appraisal and knowledge co-production. Key institutional supporters include UNDP and the World Bank, which promote synergistic sector approaches that seek to address multiple development challenges simultaneously through adaptation interventions <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2010">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland, 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the adaptation regime paradigm emerges from post-structural critiques of development by scholars such as Escobar and Ferguson. It introduces key concepts like environmentality <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal, 2005</a>)</span> and the adaptation regime <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki, 2018</a>)</span>, critically analyzing adaptation discourse as a technique of power. This paradigm employs ethnographic and discourse analysis methods, drawing extensively on case studies from Bangladesh and other climate “hotspots” to illustrate how adaptation can function as mere “spice” for conventional development projects, leading to maladaptation that may exacerbate vulnerability <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These competing approaches to adaptation reflect deeper epistemological and ontological differences in how vulnerability is understood and addressed. Before exploring these approaches in detail, we first examine how they manifest in UNFCCC negotiations, where adaptation governance is formalized and institutionalized.</p>
<section id="unfccc-negotiations" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unfccc-negotiations"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> UNFCCC Negotiations</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>UNFCCC adaptation negotiations reveal fundamental tensions between technical framing and justice concerns, with ambiguous language and procedural complexity often masking power imbalances in how adaptation is conceptualized and funded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UNFCCC understands climate damages, all the negative effects of climate change, as a kind of spillover effect. Unmitigated emissions lead to damages, unadapted damages causes losses that have to be compensated. Since the UNFCCC, like most international agreements, is negotiated by countries that have to balance their need for strong policy action and future uncertainty, the process is ambiguous <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall &amp; Persson, 2018</a>)</span>. This ambiguity manifests in deliberately vague language that can accommodate divergent interpretations, allowing countries with different positions to claim the agreement supports their view.</p>
<p>UNFCCC negotiations involve complex interactions between different country groupings with varying interests and capabilities. These include the G77 and China (representing over 130 developing countries), the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), the European Union, the Umbrella Group (including the US, Japan, Australia and others), and the Environmental Integrity Group <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall &amp; Persson, 2018</a>)</span>. These coalitions provide developing countries with greater negotiating power than they would have individually, though the diverse interests within groups like the G77 can create internal tensions.</p>
<p>The dynamics within these negotiations reflect broader power imbalances in the international system. Technical complexity, language barriers, delegation size disparities, and limited institutional capacity create challenges for many developing countries, despite formal procedural equality <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts &amp; Pelling, 2018</a>)</span>. Civil society organizations often provide technical support to vulnerable country delegations, while also using various forms of advocacy to influence the negotiation process. The private sector, particularly fossil fuel industries, also exercises significant influence, both through direct lobbying and by shaping national positions of major economies.</p>
<p>Many see the relationship between climate action and economic growth as opposites, resisting binding agreements and preferring unsubstantiated goals. This tension often manifests in debates over the scale and nature of economic transformation required to address climate change effectively. Economic analyses have traditionally framed climate policy as imposing costs that must be weighed against the benefits of avoided damages, with models typically showing modest optimal carbon prices that increase gradually over time <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall &amp; Persson, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Convention has room for multiple interpretations of most aspects of it, and there are two main ways of understanding the relation between the pillars. The first one is that the goal is to <em>minimize the damage</em> as much as possible by mitigating as much as possible, and that adaptation and loss and damage are there as a safety precaution. This perspective, often advanced by developed countries and mainstream economic analyses, emphasizes maximizing mitigation efforts to reduce the need for adaptation and loss and damage measures.</p>
<p>The second is that there exists an <em>optimal combination of mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage</em> that uses the resources more efficiently. This view, grounded in economic efficiency logic, suggests balancing investments across all three pillars based on cost-benefit analyses that consider the marginal returns to different types of climate action <span class="citation" data-cites="mechler2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mechler2020" role="doc-biblioref">Mechler et al., 2020</a>)</span>. It recognizes that some level of climate change is already unavoidable, making adaptation necessary regardless of mitigation efforts, and that in some cases, adaptation may be more cost-effective than extremely expensive mitigation options.</p>
<p>This economically-oriented framing has been criticized for several reasons. First, it tends to obscure questions of justice and equity by focusing narrowly on aggregate costs and benefits without adequate attention to their distribution. Second, it struggles to account for non-economic values, including cultural heritage, biodiversity, and human lives, that cannot be readily monetized. Third, it typically applies high discount rates that effectively devalue future impacts, raising intergenerational equity concerns <span class="citation" data-cites="williams2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-williams2020" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond these economic frameworks, some scholars and activists argue for rights-based or justice-oriented approaches that prioritize the needs and perspectives of those most vulnerable to climate impacts, regardless of economic efficiency calculations <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts &amp; Pelling, 2018</a>)</span>. These approaches emphasize historical responsibility for emissions, procedural justice in decision-making, and recognition of diverse values and knowledge systems.</p>
<p>Indigenous perspectives offer yet another framing that often emphasizes relationships, reciprocity, and responsibilities to future generations and non-human beings. These approaches typically involve more holistic understandings of climate change that situate it within broader patterns of colonialism, extraction, and disruption of Indigenous relationships with lands and waters <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2013" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland &amp; McKinnon, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These diverse perspectives on the relationship between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage reflect broader tensions in climate governance between technocratic approaches that seek optimal policy designs and more political approaches that emphasize power, justice, and competing values. The integration of these three pillars continues to evolve, with ongoing debates about their proper balance, financing, and implementation. As climate impacts intensify and the window for limiting warming to 1.5°C narrows, these discussions take on increasing urgency within and beyond the UNFCCC process.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The adaptation nexus approach builds on participatory development traditions to frame adaptation as a technical challenge requiring synergistic sector interventions, emphasizing assets, capabilities, and institutional adjustments within existing systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adaptation nexus approach has its roots in participatory movements in the 1990s, critiquing the then paradigm of top-down development research and practice, preoccupied with governmental institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="freire1970 chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers, 1994</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-freire1970" role="doc-biblioref">Freire, 1970</a>)</span>. The participatory turn emerged as a response to decades of failed development interventions that imposed external solutions without understanding local contexts or incorporating local knowledge. Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy emphasized dialogue and conscientization as alternatives to what he termed the “banking model” of education and development, where experts simply deposited knowledge into supposedly empty vessels <span class="citation" data-cites="freire1970">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-freire1970" role="doc-biblioref">Freire, 1970</a>)</span>. Robert Chambers similarly challenged development professionals to examine their biases and recognize the value of local expertise, famously advocating for “putting the last first” <span class="citation" data-cites="chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers, 1994</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The researcher was not to observe and report, but had the ethical responsibility to include and empower the communities they researched <span class="citation" data-cites="desai2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-desai2006" role="doc-biblioref">Desai &amp; Potter, 2006</a>)</span>. This ethical reorientation reflected broader epistemological shifts in development studies, recognizing multiple ways of knowing and the value of situated knowledge. Researchers were encouraged to view themselves as facilitators rather than experts, working alongside communities to co-produce knowledge rather than extracting data for academic purposes.</p>
<p>New methods were developed to better map communities and engage them in knowledge production, such as participatory rural appraisal. These methodologies included techniques like transect walks, community mapping, seasonal calendars, and wealth ranking exercises that enabled communities to visualize and analyze their own situations <span class="citation" data-cites="chambers1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chambers1994" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers, 1994</a>)</span>. Unlike conventional survey techniques that often reinforced power differentials, these approaches were designed to be accessible to non-literate participants and to foster collective analysis.</p>
<p>The data collected was used with new analytical framework centering the individual and communities. These frameworks analyzed how livelihoods were stitched together with a mix of assets, endowments, capabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="sen2000">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-sen2000" role="doc-biblioref">Sen, 2000</a>)</span>, shaped by access <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2003">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2003" role="doc-biblioref">J.

Ribot &amp; Peluso, 2003</a>)</span> and aspirations <span class="citation" data-cites="appadurai2004">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-appadurai2004" role="doc-biblioref">Appadurai, 2004</a>)</span>, amongst others. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework became particularly influential, conceptualizing households as managing portfolios of five types of capital—natural, physical, financial, human, and social—in pursuit of diverse livelihood strategies.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach similarly shifted focus from resources or income to what people can actually do and be with those resources <span class="citation" data-cites="sen2000">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-sen2000" role="doc-biblioref">Sen, 2000</a>)</span>. By emphasizing capabilities rather than commodities, this framework highlighted how the same resources might translate into very different outcomes depending on various conversion factors, including personal characteristics, social arrangements, and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Jesse Ribot’s theory of access complemented these frameworks by examining the mechanisms through which people gain, control, and maintain access to resources <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2003">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2003" role="doc-biblioref">J. C. Ribot &amp; Peluso, 2003</a>)</span>. This approach went beyond formal property rights to consider how access is shaped by technology, capital, markets, labor, knowledge, authority, identity, and social relations. By highlighting these multiple mechanisms, Ribot’s work helped explain why formal rights often fail to translate into actual benefits for marginalized groups and how power operates in resource governance.</p>
<p>This gave valuable insight into how societies functioned, and sparked new forms of interventions, with a focus on co-management and knowledge transfer. Community-based natural resource management emerged as one application of these insights, based on the premise that local users with secure rights over resources would manage them more sustainably than distant state authorities <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal, 2005</a>)</span>. Co-management approaches similarly sought to establish partnerships between local communities and state or non-state actors in resource governance, recognizing that neither complete centralization nor complete decentralization was optimal in most contexts.</p>
<p>These approaches were not without criticism. Some scholars argued that participatory methods could be co-opted by powerful actors, reinforcing rather than challenging existing power structures. Others noted that an uncritical focus on “the local” might romanticize communities and obscure internal divisions along lines of gender, class, caste, or age. Nevertheless, these frameworks and approaches represented an important shift in development thinking toward more contextually sensitive and participatory approaches.</p>
<p>This strand of research has since become a part of the mainstream development discourse, and variations on the participatory methods being implemented by the largest aid organizations like the World Bank. The World Bank’s adoption of “community-driven development” approaches in the early 2000s represented a significant institutionalization of participatory methods, with billions of dollars channeled through programs emphasizing community control over planning decisions and resources. Similarly, the United Nations Development Programme incorporated community-based adaptation into its climate programming, emphasizing local knowledge and decision-making while providing technical and financial support <span class="citation" data-cites="ensor2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ensor2009" role="doc-biblioref">Ensor &amp; Berger, 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>They see climate adaptation as just one policy area amongst all the others, and is searching for some key sectors and for synergies between them <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2010">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland, 2010</a>)</span>. This “mainstreaming” approach seeks to incorporate adaptation considerations into existing development planning and sectoral policies rather than treating adaptation as a standalone issue. Proponents argue that mainstreaming promotes efficiency, sustainability, and coherence across different policy domains. Key sectors typically identified for adaptation mainstreaming include agriculture, water management, health, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The search for synergies between adaptation and other policy objectives has been particularly prominent in discussions of “co-benefits,” where interventions simultaneously advance adaptation goals while yielding benefits in areas such as mitigation, biodiversity conservation, or poverty reduction <span class="citation" data-cites="almenar2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-almenar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Almenar et al., 2021</a>)</span>. This emphasis on multiple benefits aligns with the efficiency logic of mainstream development institutions and responds to the reality of limited resources for addressing multiple challenges.</p>
<p>One example of this could be tree planting projects, that while their main purpose is carbon sequestration, the project could contribute in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic security through the sale of forest carbon credits to the global north. If the tree is planted as a part of a farming system as a form agroforestry, the wood could be seen as a form of long-term investment that could be harvested in 30 years</li>
<li>Food security through production of fruit</li>
<li>Gender equality by giving the responsibility for managing the trees to women</li>
<li>Environmental security by providing shade with leaves and reduce soil erosion with roots <span class="citation" data-cites="almenar2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-almenar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Almenar et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example illustrates the nexus approach’s emphasis on finding interventions that address multiple objectives simultaneously. By framing tree planting as contributing to climate mitigation, adaptation, economic development, gender equality, and environmental protection, proponents can appeal to diverse stakeholders and funding sources. Similar multi-purpose framings can be found in integrated water resource management, climate-smart agriculture, and ecosystem-based adaptation.</p>
<p>The nexus understanding sees vulnerability as an individual’s <em>lack</em> of certain skill, capability, or access to a resource. When the right resource is given, it is expected to start an upwards spiral, where outcomes will improve in all other fields as well <span class="citation" data-cites="schipper2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-schipper2020" role="doc-biblioref">Schipper, 2020</a>)</span>. This conceptualization of vulnerability focuses on characteristics of individuals or communities that make them susceptible to harm, such as limited assets, poor infrastructure, or weak institutions. It tends to frame vulnerability as a condition rather than a process, emphasizing what people lack rather than examining how and why they came to lack these resources or capabilities.</p>
<p>This framing has been criticized for its tendency to depoliticize vulnerability by focusing on technical solutions without addressing the structural factors that create vulnerability in the first place. Critics argue that by framing vulnerability as primarily a problem of individual or community capacity, the nexus approach may inadvertently place responsibility for adaptation on those with the least resources and power to transform the systems that produce vulnerability <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emphasis on synergies and win-win solutions may obscure difficult trade-offs and competing interests that are inherent in adaptation decision-making. Not all stakeholders will benefit equally from particular adaptation interventions, and some may even be harmed. The nexus approach’s tendency to emphasize positive synergies may inadequately prepare practitioners for navigating these difficult trade-offs and power dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="ribot2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ribot2013" role="doc-biblioref">J. Ribot, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite these critiques, the adaptation nexus approach remains highly influential in both research and practice, particularly among major development institutions and funding agencies. Its practical orientation, compatibility with existing institutional structures, and promise of addressing multiple objectives simultaneously contribute to its continued dominance in mainstream adaptation discourse.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The adaptation regime critique draws from post-structural analysis to reveal how adaptation discourse functions as a technique of power that constructs vulnerability in ways that legitimize conventional development interventions while foreclosing alternative futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adaptation regime has its roots in the deconstructionist anthropology of development <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-lewis2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis &amp; Mosse, 2006</a>)</span>. It is heavily influenced by the work of Michel Foucault, and critiques of the <em>discourse of development</em>. The discourse is analyzed as “a system of knowledge practices, technologies, and power relationships” that orders the relationships between people and institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis2006">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-lewis2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis &amp; Mosse, 2006, p. 4</a>)</span>. This approach draws from post-structural theory, particularly Foucault’s concepts of discourse, governmentality, and biopolitics, to analyze how power operates through knowledge production and institutional practices.</p>
<p>Central to this perspective is the understanding of discourse not simply as language but as a system that structures what can be thought, said, and done in a particular domain. Discourses establish “regimes of truth” that determine what counts as valid knowledge and who is authorized to speak it. From this perspective, development discourse constructs its objects (underdevelopment, poverty, vulnerability) in ways that simultaneously create the need for intervention and position certain actors (experts, development institutions) as uniquely qualified to intervene <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar, 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The discourses that order the relationships between rich and poor countries change over time, and development had replaced civilization, just as civilization had replaced God before it <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson, 1994</a>)</span>. The seminal pieces here are Escobar’s <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar, 1995</a>)</span> deconstruction of the development discourse in Latin America and the start of a post-development field of study and Ferguson’s <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson, 1994</a>)</span> deconstruction of development projects, finding that the projects fail in predictable ways.</p>
<p>Ferguson’s ethnographic study of development in Lesotho demonstrated how development interventions, even when failing to achieve their stated objectives, successfully expand bureaucratic state power and depoliticize poverty by rendering it a technical problem rather than a political one <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson, 1994</a>)</span>. His concept of the “anti-politics machine” highlights how development discourse systematically represents poverty and underdevelopment as technical problems requiring technical solutions, effectively sidelining questions of politics, power, and structural inequality. By framing complex political-economic realities as technical challenges amenable to expert intervention, development discourse limits the space for radical alternatives and reinforces existing power relations.</p>
<p>Escobar similarly traced how development discourse constructed the “Third World” as an object of knowledge and intervention, establishing relationships of power between experts and those to be “developed” <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar, 1995</a>)</span>. He documented how development institutions, from the World Bank to bilateral aid agencies to NGOs, produce and disseminate knowledge about developing countries that reinforces certain ways of seeing and intervening while marginalizing others. This knowledge production constitutes a form of power that shapes what interventions are considered legitimate, what outcomes are valued, and whose expertise counts.</p>
<p>These critiques laid the groundwork for the post-development school, which questioned whether development should be reformed or rejected altogether. Rather than seeking better development, post-development scholars called for alternatives to development—approaches that break with the epistemological and institutional frameworks of conventional development and create space for diverse ways of knowing and being <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar, 2018</a>)</span>. This perspective emphasized the importance of local, indigenous, and non-Western knowledge systems and practices that had been marginalized by dominant development discourse.</p>
<p>As nature and climate discourses grew to prominence, Agrawal <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal, 2005</a>)</span> argued that the new relationships should be understood as a form of <em>environmentality</em>. Adapting Foucault’s concept of governmentality to environmental contexts, Agrawal examined how environmental governance regimes produce new kinds of environmental subjects who come to care about and act toward the environment in new ways. His ethnographic study of forest councils in Kumaon, India, demonstrated how participation in new regulatory regimes transformed local residents’ subjectivities and relationships to forest resources over time.</p>
<p>This concept of environmentality provided a theoretical bridge between Foucauldian analyses of development and emerging critiques of environmental governance. It highlighted how environmental interventions, like development projects, operate not simply through coercion but through reshaping how people understand themselves and their relationships to the natural world. This perspective is particularly relevant for understanding climate adaptation, which often involves similar processes of knowledge production, subject formation, and governance at multiple scales <span class="citation" data-cites="agrawal2005">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-agrawal2005" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal, 2005</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Paprocki <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki, 2018</a>)</span> describes it as an <em>Adaptation regime</em> based on her field work in Bangladesh. She argues that some countries are constructed as climate vulnerable and therefore in need of climate adaptation and that this imaginary is closely related to other historical processes of colonialism. Through careful ethnographic work in coastal Bangladesh, Paprocki documents how a diverse set of actors, including government officials, NGO workers, scientists, and donor agency representatives, collectively produce knowledge about climate vulnerability that justifies particular kinds of interventions while foreclosing others.</p>
<p>This production of Bangladesh as the “ground zero” of climate change operates through what Paprocki terms “anticipatory ruination”—the rendering of certain places as already lost, which justifies radical interventions that might otherwise face resistance. This discursive production of climate vulnerability is not politically neutral but aligned with particular development visions that privilege urbanization, export-oriented growth, and market-based solutions over rural livelihoods and communities <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>All societal issues are reduced to be climate related, and unavoidable. This dystopian imaginary builds the groundwork for extensive experimentation, since the dystopian outlook eliminates the possible downsides. This “climate reductionism” transforms complex social, economic, and political challenges into technical problems of climate vulnerability, effectively depoliticizing issues like poverty, inequality, and land rights. By framing climate impacts as inevitable and beyond human control, the adaptation regime eliminates the space for questioning whether particular interventions are necessary or desirable, or whose interests they serve <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This, she argues, leads to dispossession as land is taken for shrimp aquaculture and migration to the cities is promoted. The poor and vulnerable that were supposed to be helped, simply are not <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki, 2018</a>)</span>. Paprocki documents how adaptation interventions in coastal Bangladesh have facilitated a transition from rice farming to export-oriented shrimp aquaculture, displacing smallholder farmers and agricultural laborers. This dispossession is justified in the name of climate adaptation, with shrimp farming presented as more viable in a climate-changed future despite its negative social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Dewan <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan, 2022</a>)</span> further develops this, highlighting the building of dams and polders as flood protection. She argues the polders built as a climate adaptation measure, are the same as the old for flood protection, and are successful at acquiring funding. Climate adaptation was <em>the spice</em> that made their applications for funding work. The only issue was that the polders did not work. By blocking the seasonal flooding and draining, the rivers became silted and needed dredging, furthering the risk of floods.</p>
<p>Dewan’s analysis illustrates how the adaptation regime recycles old development interventions under new climate adaptation labels. Polders (embankments designed to protect low-lying land from flooding) had been constructed in Bangladesh since the 1960s, with mixed results. Yet rather than learning from these experiences, similar interventions were repackaged as climate adaptation to access new funding streams. This “adaptation as spice” phenomenon reveals how the climate adaptation label is used to legitimize and secure funding for interventions that might otherwise face scrutiny or resistance <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dewan shows how these interventions often fail on their own terms, creating new vulnerabilities rather than reducing existing ones. By disrupting natural hydrological processes, the polders contributed to river siltation, waterlogging, and increased flood risk—precisely the problems they were supposed to address. This pattern of maladaptation highlights the limits of technical approaches that fail to engage with complex social-ecological systems and the knowledge of those who inhabit them <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptation regime critique extends beyond Bangladesh to other contexts where similar dynamics operate. In the Pacific Islands, scholars have documented how the construction of small island states as inevitably disappearing due to sea level rise has justified interventions focused on migration rather than supporting communities’ desires to remain and adapt in place. This “drowning islands” discourse constructs Pacific Islanders primarily as future climate refugees, obscuring their agency, resilience, and ongoing adaptation efforts. It also shifts attention from the responsibilities of high-emitting countries to reduce emissions to the supposed inevitability of displacement <span class="citation" data-cites="janzen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-janzen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Janzen et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, critical analyses have shown how adaptation programs often prioritize commercial agriculture and market integration over strengthening existing livelihood strategies and local knowledge systems. Climate adaptation has become a vehicle for promoting particular agricultural models, such as climate-smart agriculture, that align with the interests of global agribusiness and carbon markets rather than the needs and priorities of smallholder farmers. These interventions often emphasize technological solutions and market mechanisms while marginalizing social, cultural, and political dimensions of vulnerability <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>eriksen2015?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of urban adaptation, scholars have documented how adaptation planning in cities like New York, Rotterdam, and Mumbai privileges the protection of valuable real estate and economic assets over addressing the needs of marginalized communities. These interventions often reproduce existing patterns of socio-spatial inequality, with adaptation benefits accruing disproportionately to already privileged groups while adaptation burdens fall more heavily on the poor and marginalized <span class="citation" data-cites="scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Across these diverse contexts, similar patterns emerge of vulnerability being constructed in ways that align with existing development paradigms rather than challenging them. Adaptation interventions reproduce rather than transform the political-economic relations that generate vulnerability in the first place. The adaptation regime operates not through simple imposition but through the production of knowledge, subjects, and governance arrangements that make particular approaches seem natural, necessary, and inevitable <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>eriksen2015?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Critics have also examined the role of visualization technologies and media representations in producing the adaptation regime’s dystopian imaginaries. Climate models, vulnerability maps, and disaster photography together constitute seemingly objective perspectives that mask their partial and situated nature. These visual technologies produce certain places and populations as exceptionally vulnerable, justifying interventions by external experts while often marginalizing local understandings of environmental change and appropriate responses <span class="citation" data-cites="scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptation regime critique does not deny the reality of climate impacts or the need for adaptation. Rather, it questions who defines what adaptation means, whose knowledge counts in designing interventions, and who benefits from adaptation funding. It calls attention to how adaptation discourses and practices can reproduce rather than challenge existing power relations, and how they may foreclose alternative futures that do not align with dominant development paradigms <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2013" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland &amp; McKinnon, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This critical perspective has begun to influence adaptation practice, with growing attention to questions of justice, transformation, and alternative knowledge systems. Some scholars and practitioners are exploring how adaptation might be reimagined as a site of contestation and possibility rather than technical management—a space where communities can articulate and pursue their own visions of climate-just futures. These approaches emphasize the political nature of adaptation decisions and seek to democratize adaptation governance in ways that center the agency and knowledge of those most affected by climate impacts <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps most fundamentally, the adaptation regime critique challenges us to rethink what counts as adaptation and who gets to decide. It suggests that true adaptation may require transforming the social, economic, and political systems that produce vulnerability in the first place, rather than simply adjusting to their outcomes. This may involve reimagining and reconfiguring relationships between humans and non-humans, between present and future generations, and between different ways of knowing and being in the world <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
