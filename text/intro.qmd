# Introduction {#sec-intro}

>Climate change is dangerous, unfair and already here. 

Climate action has become a global phenomenon, a common story and goal, to different peoples in wildly different contexts. The action is motivated by urgency and agency, moralism and utility. Everyone wants to achieve climate justice, but how, and for whom? 

The stories I have been exposed to span, "We need climate action to stay competitive in the world markets", "We need climate action to save biodiversity", "I need people to buy carbon credits so I can put food on the table". Needless to say, this list could be much longer. The many actors and overlapping stories make this field hard to capture and describe. The main goal of this thesis is to highlight the ways the stories collide. 

Climate justice could be imagined as a spillover effect. Greenhouse gas emissions lead to changes in ecosystems, ecosystem change could lead to damages. If these damages fall exclusivlt (or disproportionally) on other than those responsible for the emissions, this in climate injustice. Climate mitigation are actions taken to avoid the emissions in the first place, also often referred to as a green transition. Climate adaptation are actions taken to avoid damages from ecosystem change, this is often also called climate security. Loss and damage is compansation for damages incurred. The negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) often tries to find an optimal outcome, poltical economy wise. 

Climate adaptation is a form of anticipatory governance, where the future is predicted and imagined, and measures are taken to reduce risk. There is a large degree of uncertainty, both in the actual events (hurricanes, cyclones, droughts and floods) and their impacts. The quantification of this risk is also uncertain, as value is understood differently between contexts, and might change over time. In other words, how one views climate adaptation is based on a tapestry of assumtions of the world.

Our worldviews are made up by the stories we share. They structure our world, assign our roles and tells us who to listen to. They shape what we deem reasonable, acceptable and preferable. They justify our actions, and tells us who belongs and should be excluded. In the global North, we assume this story to be universal, a claim that decolonal schoars challenge. Rather, they argue that the stories we tell, the knowledge systems we surround ourself with, are a cite of power struggle, where the dominant systems systematically eliminate the others. This thesis engages with this claim empirically.

[Societies change when our worldviews are challenged. Major changes, such as the suffragettes, the civil rights movement etc.etc. were struggles about *who counts*. Former colonies were granted their freedom because they were now seen as nations in their own right. By engaging with the stories that justified the oppressions of women and minorities, the natural conclusion became that everyone are *people*. This is despite the law saying otherwise.]

[As I am writing this thesis, the world is experiencing the opposite development. The Putin regime claims Ukrainians do not exist, the Trump regime claims transgender peoples do not exsist. ]

This thesis argues that the current climate regime re-tells the story of underdevelopment. 

## Scope

This thesis is based on text-mining and topic modeling all National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) subitted to the UNFCCC. This analysis squarly targets the official policy documents submitted to the UNFCCC. It recongnizes, and highlights, that these countries rarely are perfect representatives of their citizens. I use this 

This thesis addresses three central research questions:

- What view of climate justice does adaptation have? What are their implications?
- How are climate adaptation interventions justified? Who decides?
- Is climate adaptation an effective way of delivering climate justice? 

## Disposition

After this introduction-section, the thesis continues. It is structured in three main parts. This is to cleanly separate the case I present from the research design I develop, and the analysis I do when I combine them. 

Part 1 argues that climate adaptation is the most future oriented of the pillars of the UNFCCC, and 
[@sec-context] argues that climate adaptation is becoming a central part of development governance, where the goal is to finesse the three pillars to get the optimal political economy outcome, while [@sec-lit] argues that the two main strands of research in climate adaptation mirror their roots in development and decolonial studies.

Part 2 argues that discourse centralization is a key metric to understand the different worldviews and their dominance in the discourse. [@sec-theory] argues that the future is not a given destiny, but shaped by the decitions made and the worldview (and past-/future-view) that shapes them and [@sec-methods] introduced the dominance index as a measure of the discourse centralization. 

Part 3 argues that climate adaptation is a difficult, violent and ineffective way to deliver climate justice. [@sec-findings] argues adaptation discourse shows remarkably high centralization, with income level explaining more variance than geography and region and [@sec-discussion] argues the high concentration should be understood as a possible epistemicide.

Lastly, I conclude that the finessing of the UNFCCC works as a COP-out for countries in the global north to avoid cutting emmissions. Serious climate mitigation seems like a much preferable alternative that avoids foreclosing any futures in teh global south.
