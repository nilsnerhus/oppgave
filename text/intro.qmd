# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Climate adaptation has become a universal imperative, yet the stories that drive it are strikingly diverse. In corporate boardrooms, executives declare "we need climate action to stay competitive in world markets." Conservation organizations insist "we need climate action to save biodiversity." In rural communities, farmers simply state "I need people to buy carbon credits so I can put food on the table."

These narratives—economic, ecological, existential—seem to demand fundamentally different responses. A corporation's competitiveness strategy should look nothing like a biodiversity protection plan, which in turn should differ from a smallholder's survival strategy. Yet when we examine how climate adaptation actually unfolds through formal planning processes, a puzzling pattern emerges.

Countries facing radically different climate futures—small island states confronting rising seas, landlocked nations battling desertification, mountain kingdoms losing glaciers—produce remarkably similar adaptation plans. Their National Adaptation Plans, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), converge on the same topics: institutional arrangements, financial mechanisms, capacity building, monitoring frameworks. The diversity of climate impacts meets the homogeneity of climate responses.

This convergence cannot be explained by shared environmental challenges, as the challenges themselves are profoundly different. Instead, the pattern points to something more systematic: the operation of what development anthropologists call "Aidland"—a transnational space where consultants, frameworks, and expertise circulate, creating standardized approaches to diverse problems [@mosse2011]. The same consulting firms work across multiple countries. The same templates structure different plans. The same indicators measure disparate realities.

## The Hundred Billion Dollar COP-Out

The title of this thesis captures this puzzle in its double meaning. Climate adaptation represents both a literal "Conference of Parties outcome"—the institutional response to demands for climate justice through the $100 billion promised at Copenhagen (2009) and the $300 billion pledged at COP29 (2024). But it also constitutes a "cop-out" in the colloquial sense: an evasion of responsibility. While Southern countries reshape their societies through adaptation planning, Northern countries continue the emissions that drive climate change. While consultants design resilience projects in vulnerable communities, the systems producing vulnerability continue unabated.

This represents what the concept of "vulnerability" now plays in global relations—a role remarkably similar to "underdevelopment" in the twentieth century. Where once countries were diagnosed as underdeveloped and required development, they are now assessed as vulnerable and need adaptation. Where development economists calculated GDP gaps, climate scientists now model exposure indices. Where structural adjustment programs promised to fix economic deficiencies, adaptation projects now promise to address climatic ones. The vocabulary has changed, but the underlying structure persists: Southern deficiency requires Northern expertise.

## Research Questions and Approach

To investigate this adaptation apparatus, I pose three research questions that probe different dimensions of the adaptation regime:

**First, how does climate adaptation planning conceptualize justice, and what possibilities does this enable or foreclose?** When vulnerability is framed primarily as technical deficiency requiring external expertise, what happens to questions of historical responsibility, reparations, or structural transformation?

**Second, through what mechanisms and whose knowledge do adaptation interventions become legitimate and necessary?** How do certain ways of understanding vulnerability achieve dominance while others are marginalized? When communities have adapted to environmental variability for generations, why do they suddenly need external experts to teach them adaptation?

**Third, does the current adaptation regime advance climate justice or reproduce colonial relations under new vocabularies?** When the same consultants apply the same frameworks across different contexts, are they supporting diverse adaptations or imposing singular visions?

To answer these questions, I employ a novel approach that makes visible patterns typically hidden in the sheer volume of policy documents. Using computational text analysis, specifically structural topic modeling, I identify thematic patterns that structure adaptation discourse across all 45 National Adaptation Plans submitted to the UNFCCC. The key innovation is the Dominance Index—a measure of discourse centralization that quantifies the degree to which adaptation planning concentrates on narrow themes versus embracing diverse approaches.

## Key Findings: Epistemicide in Action

The analysis reveals remarkably high discourse centralization across all National Adaptation Plans. Countries show dominance values substantially above baseline, ranging from 59.9% to 98.0%, indicating that adaptation discourse concentrates on a narrow set of topics despite diverse contexts. This universal concentration suggests systematic constraints operating across all adaptation planning rather than context-specific responses to environmental challenges.

Most significantly, procedural topics dominate adaptation discourse regardless of climate vulnerabilities. Topics related to planning processes, institutional arrangements, and financial mechanisms appear among the top themes across virtually all country groupings, accounting for approximately 40% of total discourse. Environmental challenges matter less than institutional requirements in shaping what countries discuss in their adaptation plans.

The p-value patterns reveal a crucial insight about autonomy and dependence: higher-income countries show weaker group constraints (higher p-values), indicating greater discourse autonomy, while lower-income countries show stronger institutional capture (lower p-values). This provides statistical validation that financial dependence shapes discourse homogenization—countries must speak the language of international institutions to access climate finance.

## Theoretical Framework: Beyond Technical Planning

These patterns become theoretically legible through Boaventura de Sousa Santos's concept of "epistemicide"—the systematic destruction of knowledge systems that do not conform to dominant frameworks [@santos2016]. Adaptation planning operates not through direct suppression but through the more subtle violence of exclusion and non-recognition. Traditional ecological knowledge, community-based practices, indigenous cosmologies, and local innovations find no legitimate expression in documents dominated by vulnerability indices and results-based management frameworks.

The convergence observed in adaptation discourse represents what critical scholars identify as the continuation of colonial violence through seemingly neutral technical processes. This connects to broader analyses of how development discourse forecloses alternative futures [@escobar1995] and how climate governance operates as an "anti-politics machine" that transforms political questions into technical problems [@ferguson1994].

## Methodological Innovation

The methodological contribution lies in developing tools that can reveal the operation of power in large-scale governance processes. The Dominance Index makes abstract concepts like epistemicide empirically tractable, showing not just that knowledge systems are marginalized but how this marginalization operates through mundane planning processes. This approach bridges critical theory and empirical analysis, providing systematic evidence for processes typically observed only through ethnographic work.

## Chapter Overview

This thesis unfolds through seven chapters that build from context through method to critique. Chapter 2 situates climate adaptation within the UNFCCC system, examining how mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage create a hierarchy that serves particular interests. Chapter 3 reviews competing perspectives on adaptation planning—the "adaptation nexus" approach seeking technical solutions and the "adaptation regime" critique revealing colonial continuities.

Chapter 4 develops the theoretical framework, drawing on epistemologies of the South, critical futures studies, and discourse analysis to understand how adaptation planning might reflect epistemological diversity or monoculture. Chapter 5 details the methodology, explaining how structural topic modeling and the Dominance Index reveal patterns of convergence and divergence.

Chapter 6 presents the empirical findings, demonstrating high discourse centralization across all categories with important variations by income level, region, and geography. Chapter 7 discusses these findings through the lens of critical theory, arguing that adaptation operates as contemporary epistemicide that forecloses alternative futures while maintaining colonial relations.

## Stakes of the Analysis

Understanding adaptation planning as potential epistemicide has implications beyond academic analysis. If current approaches systematically eliminate the knowledge systems and social arrangements that enable genuine resilience while imposing frameworks that create new dependencies, then adaptation represents not climate response but climate colonialism. This analysis becomes essential for those seeking to support communities facing climate impacts without reproducing the relations that produce vulnerability in the first place.

The question driving this research is ultimately about possibilities: Can communities adapt to environmental change according to their own knowledge and values, or will the machinery of adaptation planning continue eliminating alternatives before they can flourish? The evidence suggests that current approaches serve institutional needs while failing those most vulnerable to climate impacts. Understanding these dynamics is a necessary first step toward imagining how adaptation might operate otherwise—supporting rather than supplanting the diverse ways communities navigate environmental change.
