## Competing Visions: From Security to Freedom

Major Partagaz's chilling monologue to the Imperial Security Bureau captures a particular vision of governance that resonates far beyond the Star Wars universe. Society is a body that can fall ill. Experts are healthcare providers who diagnose symptoms and eliminate germs. Disorders must be identified and treated before they spread. This medical metaphor for social control—precise, technical, ostensibly neutral—finds its contemporary expression in the most unlikely of places: climate adaptation planning.

Across the globe, climate adaptation has become a universal imperative, yet the stories that drive it are strikingly diverse. In corporate boardrooms, executives declare "we need climate action to stay competitive in world markets." Conservation organizations insist "we need climate action to save biodiversity." In rural communities, farmers simply state "I need people to buy carbon credits so I can put food on the table." These narratives—economic, ecological, existential—seem to demand fundamentally different responses. A corporation's competitiveness strategy should look nothing like a biodiversity protection plan, which in turn should differ from a smallholder's survival strategy.

Yet when we examine how climate adaptation actually unfolds through formal planning processes, a puzzling pattern emerges. Countries facing radically different climate futures—small island states confronting rising seas, landlocked nations battling desertification, mountain kingdoms losing glaciers—produce remarkably similar adaptation plans. Their National Adaptation Plans, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), converge on the same topics: institutional arrangements, financial mechanisms, capacity building, monitoring frameworks. The diversity of climate impacts meets the homogeneity of climate responses.

This convergence cannot be explained by shared environmental challenges, as the challenges themselves are profoundly different. Instead, the pattern points to something more systemic: the operation of what development anthropologists call the "Aidland" [@mosse2011]—a transnational space where consultants, frameworks, and expertise circulate, creating standardized approaches to diverse problems. The same consulting firms work across multiple countries. The same templates structure different plans. The same indicators measure disparate realities. Like a traveling circus, this apparatus moves from capital to capital, performing the same show regardless of local context.

The consultant arrives in Dhaka or Dar es Salaam carrying frameworks developed in Washington or Geneva. They conduct stakeholder workshops, perform vulnerability assessments, and compile sector analyses. They translate complex local realities into standardized formats that international funders can recognize and process. Communities who have navigated environmental uncertainty for generations suddenly learn they lack "adaptive capacity." Traditional practices that maintained resilience for centuries are rendered invisible, not through malice but through frameworks that simply cannot see them. The consultant's toolkit—logical frameworks, results chains, theory of change diagrams—shapes not just how adaptation is planned but what adaptation can even mean.

This brings us to a radically different vision, offered by another character from the same series:

> "Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause."
> 
> —Nemik, _Andor_

Nemik's manifesto presents freedom not as something to be planned, managed, or delivered, but as an emergent property of human existence. It occurs "spontaneously and without instruction"—outside the frameworks, beneath the radar, beyond the plans. This vision suggests that adaptation too might emerge not from technical assessments and institutional arrangements but from communities exercising their autonomy, drawing on their own knowledge, creating their own futures.

The tension between these visions—Partagaz's technocratic control and Nemik's spontaneous freedom—defines the contemporary climate adaptation regime. On one side, an apparatus that diagnoses vulnerability, prescribes interventions, and monitors compliance. On the other, the persistent reality of human communities who have always adapted to environmental change through their own knowledge systems, social arrangements, and creative responses. The question is not which vision is correct, but which is winning. When adaptation becomes legible to international institutions, what happens to the forms of adaptation that flourish outside their frameworks?

## The New Underdevelopment: Vulnerability as Justification

To understand how climate adaptation operates today, we must recognize its lineage. In the twentieth century, the concept of "underdevelopment" transformed global relations. Suddenly, diverse societies pursuing different ways of life were repositioned on a single scale from "backward" to "advanced." This was not a neutral description but an active construction that justified intervention. If a society was underdeveloped, it required development. If it lacked capacity, it needed technical assistance. If it was traditional, it must be modernized. The development apparatus that emerged—with its experts, frameworks, and flows of capital—promised to deliver progress while often delivering dependency.

Today, "vulnerability" plays a remarkably similar role. Where once countries were diagnosed as underdeveloped, they are now assessed as vulnerable. Where development economists calculated GDP gaps, climate scientists now model exposure to extreme events. Where structural adjustment programs promised to fix economic deficiencies, adaptation projects now promise to address climatic ones. The vocabulary has changed, but the underlying structure persists: Southern deficiency requires Northern expertise.

The financial promises that accompany this new framing are substantial. At Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020—a figure that captured headlines and hope in equal measure. By COP29 in Baku in 2024, this had grown to a promise of $300 billion annually by 2035. These sums suggest serious commitment to climate justice, a recognition that those least responsible for climate change should not bear its costs alone. Yet examining how this finance flows reveals troubling patterns.

The primary vehicle for adaptation planning under the UNFCCC is the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). These documents, now submitted by 45 countries, are meant to identify climate vulnerabilities and outline systematic responses. They serve as both planning tools and funding proposals, demonstrating need while showcasing capacity to manage resources. In practice, NAPs have become the new national development plans—comprehensive documents that must speak to multiple audiences, satisfy diverse requirements, and transform messy realities into neat project packages.

The parallel goes deeper than format. Just as development planning transformed political questions about global inequality into technical problems of resource allocation, adaptation planning transforms questions about climate justice into matters of project management. Why are coastal communities vulnerable to storm surges? A political analysis might point to histories of displacement that pushed populations to marginal lands, industrial development that destroyed protective mangroves, or global economic systems that concentrate risk among the poor. But within the technical framework of adaptation planning, vulnerability appears as insufficient seawalls, inadequate early warning systems, or lacking evacuation plans. The prescription follows from the diagnosis: build barriers, install sirens, conduct drills.

This technical framing creates a profound paradox at the heart of climate adaptation. We face heterogeneous impacts: sea-level rise threatens to submerge entire nations while droughts desiccate others; hurricanes intensify in some regions while floods increase in others; glacial melt transforms mountain economies while coral bleaching devastates reef-dependent communities. These diverse impacts, one might expect, would generate diverse responses reflecting different contexts, priorities, and possibilities. Instead, we see homogeneous planning—the same institutional frameworks, financial mechanisms, and technical approaches appearing across radically different contexts.

The homogenization occurs not by accident but by design. To access climate finance, countries must make themselves legible to funding institutions. This requires adopting standardized frameworks, using recognized methodologies, and producing expected outputs. A vulnerability assessment must follow established protocols. A project proposal must fit logical frameworks. Success must be measurable through predetermined indicators. Countries learn to see themselves through these tools, to articulate their needs in these languages, to plan their futures within these constraints.

This represents what the title of this thesis captures in its double meaning: a COP-out. In one sense, it refers literally to an outcome of the Conference of Parties—the institutional response to demands for climate justice through adaptation finance. But in the colloquial sense, it represents an evasion of responsibility. While Southern countries reshape their societies through adaptation planning, Northern countries continue the emissions that drive climate change. While consultants design resilience projects in vulnerable communities, the systems producing vulnerability continue unabated. While adaptation finance flows (slowly and conditionally), the fossil fuel economy expands.

The genius of the adaptation regime is that it transforms moral and political questions into technical and financial ones. Rather than reparations for historical emissions, we have voluntary climate finance. Rather than binding commitments to rapid decarbonization, we have nationally determined contributions. Rather than addressing the structural drivers of vulnerability, we have project-based interventions. The result is a system that appears to address climate injustice while carefully avoiding anything that might require fundamental change in the global order.

What disappears in this transformation is precisely what Nemik's vision of freedom suggests: the possibility that communities might adapt through their own knowledge, institutions, and aspirations rather than through externally designed projects. When adaptation is reduced to what can be planned, funded, and measured by international institutions, other forms of adaptation—those emerging spontaneously from human creativity and collective action—become invisible. This is not a failure of planning but its success: the rendering of diverse human responses to environmental change into standardized technical interventions that reinforce rather than challenge existing power relations.

## Uncovering the Machinery: Questions, Methods, and Map

This thesis investigates the machinery of climate adaptation planning by examining what happens when 45 countries submit their National Adaptation Plans to the UNFCCC. These documents, running to thousands of pages collectively, represent the official articulation of how nations understand climate vulnerability and plan to respond. They are windows into possible futures—but whose futures, imagined how, and with what consequences?

To understand what these documents reveal, I pose three research questions that probe different dimensions of the adaptation regime:

**First, how does climate adaptation planning conceptualize justice, and what possibilities does this enable or foreclose?** This question examines the implicit theories of justice embedded in adaptation discourse. When vulnerability is framed primarily as a technical deficiency requiring external expertise, what happens to questions of historical responsibility, reparations, or structural transformation? When justice is operationalized as resource transfer through project mechanisms, what forms of justice become unspeakable?

**Second, through what mechanisms and whose knowledge do adaptation interventions become legitimate and necessary?** This question investigates the knowledge politics of adaptation. How do certain ways of understanding vulnerability achieve dominance while others are marginalized? What role do consultants, frameworks, and institutional requirements play in shaping what counts as legitimate adaptation? When communities have adapted to environmental variability for generations, why do they suddenly need external experts to teach them adaptation?

**Third, does the current adaptation regime advance climate justice or reproduce colonial relations under new vocabularies?** This question directly confronts the claimed purpose of adaptation finance. If adaptation planning operates like Partagaz's ISB—diagnosing disorders and prescribing treatments based on external expertise—does it enable Southern autonomy or deepen Northern control? When the same consultants apply the same frameworks across different contexts, are they supporting diverse adaptations or imposing singular visions?

To answer these questions, I employ a novel approach that makes visible patterns typically hidden in the sheer volume of policy documents. Using computational text analysis, specifically structural topic modeling, I identify the thematic patterns that structure adaptation discourse across all NAPs. This method reveals not just what individual countries say but how the collective discourse converges or diverges. The key innovation is the Dominance Index, a measure of discourse centralization that quantifies the degree to which adaptation planning concentrates on a narrow set of themes versus embracing diverse approaches.

When discourse is highly centralized—when most countries emphasize the same topics despite facing different challenges—it suggests the successful operation of homogenizing forces. When discourse is decentralized—when countries pursue different thematic emphases—it indicates space for diverse approaches. By measuring centralization across different groupings (by income level, region, and geography), we can identify what factors shape adaptation discourse. Does shared vulnerability to sea-level rise create common discourse among small island states? Or do regional institutional networks have more influence than physical geography in shaping how adaptation is conceived?

This approach bridges critical theory and empirical analysis. It takes seriously the post-development critique that Northern frameworks eliminate Southern knowledge systems—what Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls "epistemicide" [@santos2016]. But rather than simply asserting this occurs, the analysis demonstrates it quantitatively, showing how adaptation discourse converges on particular framings while excluding others. The patterns revealed are not merely academic findings but windows into how power operates through seemingly neutral technical processes.

The theoretical contribution is to empirically validate critical perspectives on climate governance that have been developed through ethnographic and philosophical work. When Arturo Escobar argues that development discourse forecloses alternative futures [@escobar1995], the convergence patterns in NAPs provide systematic evidence. When James Ferguson describes development as an "anti-politics machine" that transforms political questions into technical ones [@ferguson1994], the dominance of procedural and financial topics in adaptation plans offers confirmation. The analysis shows these are not isolated cases but systematic patterns operating across the entire adaptation regime.

The methodological contribution is developing tools that can reveal the operation of power in large-scale governance processes. The Dominance Index makes abstract concepts like "epistemicide" empirically tractable. It shows not just that knowledge systems are marginalized but how this marginalization operates through the mundane processes of planning and documentation. This matters because what cannot be measured often cannot be contested. By making patterns of domination visible, we create possibilities for resistance.

The political implications are perhaps most significant. If adaptation planning operates as epistemicide—systematically eliminating alternative ways of knowing and responding to environmental change—then current approaches are not merely inadequate but actively harmful. They eliminate the knowledge systems and social arrangements that enable genuine resilience while imposing frameworks that create new dependencies. Understanding these dynamics is essential for those seeking to support communities facing climate impacts without reproducing colonial relations.

This thesis unfolds in three parts that build from context through method to critique. Part I situates climate adaptation within the broader landscape of climate governance and development theory. Chapter 2 traces how adaptation emerged as a distinct pillar of the UNFCCC, examining the institutional arrangements, financial mechanisms, and power dynamics that shape contemporary adaptation governance. Chapter 3 reviews two competing perspectives on adaptation: the "adaptation nexus" approach that seeks technical solutions within existing systems, and the "adaptation regime" critique that sees adaptation as extending colonial relations through new vocabularies.

Part II develops the theoretical and methodological framework for analyzing adaptation discourse. Chapter 4 presents the theoretical foundations, drawing on work about epistemologies of the South, critical futures studies, and discourse analysis to understand how adaptation planning might reflect either epistemological diversity or monoculture. Chapter 5 details the methodology, explaining how structural topic modeling and the Dominance Index can reveal patterns of convergence and divergence in adaptation discourse.

Part III presents and interprets the empirical findings. Chapter 6 reports the results of analyzing 45 NAPs, showing high discourse centralization overall but important variations across income levels, regions, and geographic categories. Chapter 7 discusses these findings through the lens of critical theory, arguing that adaptation operates as contemporary epistemicide that forecloses alternative futures while maintaining colonial relations. The conclusion returns to the fundamental question of climate justice, arguing that genuine transformation requires not better planning but recognition of the multiple worlds that exist beyond adaptation frameworks.

Throughout this journey, the tension between Partagaz and Nemik remains central. Can freedom occur spontaneously within climate governance, or does the machinery of adaptation planning successfully diagnose and eliminate alternatives before they can flourish? The evidence suggests that current approaches serve Partagaz's vision all too well—identifying "disorders" in Southern societies and prescribing "treatments" that often worsen the underlying condition. Yet Nemik's insight remains: freedom persists, emerging in the spaces that planning cannot reach, in the practices it cannot see, in the futures it cannot imagine. The question is whether these spaces of freedom can survive and expand, or whether the apparatus of adaptation will continue its work of rendering the world legible to power while eliminating the alternatives that might enable genuine transformation.

This thesis is ultimately about that struggle—between homogenization and diversity, between control and autonomy, between the futures that planning enables and those it forecloses. By making visible how adaptation discourse operates, we take a first step toward imagining how it might operate otherwise. If the current regime represents a COP-out that allows the North to avoid fundamental change while reshaping the South, then understanding its machinery is essential for those seeking genuine climate justice. The task is not to perfect the machinery but to recognize, as Nemik suggests, that real transformation may emerge not from our plans but from the freedom that persists despite them.
