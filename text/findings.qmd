# Findings: Patterns of Discourse Centralization in National Adaptation Plans

This chapter presents the empirical results of applying the Dominance Index methodology to National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC. The analysis reveals significant patterns in how adaptation discourse is structured across different country groupings, providing insights into the degree of centralization or diversity in how countries conceptualize climate adaptation.

The primary analysis uses a Dominance Index focused on the top three topics (n=3) rather than the top five (n=5). This decision reflects both methodological and theoretical considerations. With a topic model containing 15 topics (K=15), examining the top three topics represents a focus on 20% of the possible topics, providing a more discriminating measure of centralization than the more inclusive n=5 approach. The n=3 configuration also shows greater variation across different country groupings, enabling more meaningful comparative analysis. Moreover, the n=3 results align more closely with theoretical expectations regarding the influence of development frameworks on adaptation discourse, as will be discussed throughout this chapter.

The overall Dominance Index for the entire corpus is 0.949, with confidence intervals ranging from 0.928 to 0.970. This remarkably high value indicates that adaptation discourse across all NAPs is highly centralized, with just three topics dominating nearly 95% of the discourse. Such a high level of centralization suggests limited epistemological diversity in how countries frame adaptation challenges and solutions, despite the diverse contexts in which adaptation occurs. This finding aligns with critical perspectives that have questioned the space for diverse knowledge systems within international climate governance frameworks.

The overall standard deviation is 0.071, indicating some variation in dominance patterns across individual NAPs, but this variation appears more structured when examined through different dimensional groupings. The bullseye visualization (Figure 5.1) illustrates this centralization, with the majority of topics clustered near the periphery while three dominant topics occupy central positions. This pattern visually represents the concentration of discourse around a limited set of conceptual frameworks.

This chapter explores how the dominance patterns vary across three key dimensions: income level, geographical region, and special geographical status (Small Island Developing States and Landlocked Developing Countries). For each dimension, we examine the patterns revealed by the Dominance Index, compare these patterns to theoretical expectations, and analyze potential explanations for observed differences. The analysis reveals that income level explains the greatest proportion of variance in dominance patterns (8.1%), narrowly surpassing regional groupings (8.0%), with geography explaining substantially less (3.7%). These patterns offer important insights into how adaptation discourse is shaped by existing development frameworks and institutional arrangements.

## Findings Across Income

### The Findings

Income level emerges as the primary explanatory factor for variations in discourse centralization, accounting for 8.1% of the variance in dominance patterns. This finding suggests that a country's economic classification has a stronger influence on how it frames adaptation than either its geographical region or special status. The dominance patterns across income groups reveal a clear relationship between economic development and discourse centralization:

Low-income countries display the highest level of discourse centralization, with a dominance index of 0.980 (CI: 0.968-0.992). This exceptionally high value indicates that adaptation discourse in these countries is highly concentrated around three dominant topics, with minimal space for alternative frameworks or approaches. Moreover, low-income countries show the lowest internal variation (standard deviation = 0.018), suggesting remarkable consistency in discourse patterns across this group despite diverse geographical and cultural contexts.

High-income countries follow with the second-highest dominance index at 0.974 (CI: 0.934-1.015), though the wider confidence interval reflects the smaller sample size (n=3) for this group. Upper-middle income countries show a somewhat lower dominance index of 0.947 (CI: 0.916-0.978), while lower-middle income countries exhibit the lowest centralization with a dominance index of 0.928 (CI: 0.880-0.975).

Notably, lower-middle income countries display the highest internal variation (standard deviation = 0.094), indicating greater diversity in how adaptation is conceptualized within this group. This higher variation suggests that countries in this income category may have more flexibility or capacity to develop distinct approaches to adaptation, even as their discourse remains relatively centralized compared to theoretical possibilities.

The patterns across income groups are statistically significant, with non-overlapping confidence intervals between low-income countries and lower-middle income countries. The difference between upper-middle and lower-middle income countries is less pronounced but still notable. Figure 5.2 visualizes these differences, showing how the bullseye patterns become increasingly concentrated as we move from lower-middle to low-income countries.

### The Expectations

The relationship between income level and discourse centralization connects to several theoretical expectations drawn from the literature. The adaptation regime critique developed by scholars such as @paprocki2018 and @dewan2022 suggests that adaptation discourse functions as an extension of existing development frameworks, with power dynamics from development relationships shaping how adaptation is conceptualized and implemented. This perspective would predict significant alignment between income-based development categories and adaptation discourse patterns.

From this critical perspective, we might expect low-income countries to show higher discourse centralization due to greater dependency on international funding and technical assistance for adaptation planning. Countries with limited resources for independent policy development often rely more heavily on international consultants and frameworks provided by multilateral institutions, potentially reducing the space for alternative knowledge systems or approaches [@eriksen2021].

Conversely, the adaptation nexus approach might suggest more variation within income groups, as countries draw on participatory methods and local knowledge to develop context-specific adaptation strategies [@ensor2009]. This perspective would expect middle-income countries to show greater discourse diversity as they balance international frameworks with growing capacity for autonomous policy development.

Our research hypothesis anticipated that income would be a significant factor in explaining discourse patterns, but not necessarily the primary factor. We expected geographical region might exert equal or greater influence, given the importance of regional knowledge networks and institutional arrangements in climate governance. The finding that income slightly outweighs region as an explanatory factor thus partially challenges our initial expectations.

### Why It Is Different

The finding that low-income countries exhibit both the highest discourse centralization and the lowest internal variation requires careful interpretation. This pattern likely reflects multiple interrelated factors shaping how these countries approach adaptation planning.

First, low-income countries typically have the most limited institutional capacity for developing adaptation plans independently. Many rely extensively on technical assistance from international organizations, consultants, and donors to prepare their NAPs [@hall2018]. This reliance creates a pathway for international frameworks and terminologies to dominate national planning documents, regardless of their appropriateness for local contexts. When multiple countries receive assistance from the same international organizations or consultant groups, their resulting plans may naturally converge around similar conceptual frameworks.

Second, low-income countries face the greatest dependency on international climate finance. The preparation of NAPs often serves not only as a planning exercise but as a means of accessing adaptation funding [@persson2014]. This dual purpose creates incentives for countries to frame their adaptation needs in terms that align with donor priorities and expectations, potentially limiting the space for alternative framings that might not resonate with funding mechanisms. As @dewan2022 observed in Bangladesh, climate change often becomes a "spice" added to conventional development projects to attract funding, rather than catalyzing fundamentally different approaches.

Third, the lower-middle income category shows the greatest internal variation, suggesting these countries may occupy a transitional space where they have sufficient capacity to develop more distinctive approaches while still engaging with international frameworks. Countries in this group may be less dependent on external assistance for NAP development, enabling greater reflection of national priorities and knowledge systems. The diversity within this group may also reflect different development trajectories and governance approaches, creating space for more varied adaptation framings.

The finding that income explains more variance than expected challenges perspectives that emphasize the context-specific nature of adaptation. Despite rhetoric about locally-appropriate solutions and country-driven planning, these results suggest that adaptation discourse remains significantly structured along existing development categories. This pattern aligns with @scoville-simonds2020's argument about the "hazards of mainstreaming" adaptation into existing development frameworks, which may reinforce rather than transform unequal power relations.

These findings do not necessarily indicate that income directly determines how countries conceptualize adaptation. Rather, income level likely serves as a proxy for broader structural relationships in international governance, including access to resources, institutional capacity, and positioning within knowledge networks. The dominance of income as an explanatory factor reveals how deeply adaptation discourse is embedded within existing development paradigms, despite the distinct challenges that climate change presents.

## Findings Across Region

### The Findings

Regional groupings emerge as the second most powerful explanatory factor for discourse centralization patterns, accounting for 8.0% of the variance—only slightly less than income level. This finding suggests that regional dynamics play a substantial role in shaping how countries conceptualize and articulate adaptation challenges and responses.

The regional analysis reveals significant variation in dominance patterns across different geographical areas. Sub-Saharan Africa shows the highest level of discourse centralization among the regions, with a dominance index of 0.967 (CI: 0.943-0.991). This high value indicates that adaptation discourse in Sub-Saharan African NAPs is highly concentrated around three dominant topics. South Asia follows with a similarly high dominance index of 0.959 (CI: 0.922-0.996), while Europe & Central Asia ranks third with a dominance index of 0.969 (CI: 0.939-0.999).

In contrast, East Asia & Pacific displays the lowest regional centralization with a dominance index of 0.924 (CI: 0.865-0.982), followed closely by the Middle East & North Africa at 0.919 (CI: 0.773-1.065). Latin America & Caribbean occupies an intermediate position with a dominance index of 0.941 (CI: 0.889-0.993).

Internal variation within regions also shows notable patterns. The Middle East & North Africa exhibits the highest standard deviation (0.149), indicating substantial diversity in how countries within this region approach adaptation planning. This high variation may reflect the diverse political and economic contexts within the region, though the small sample size (n=4) suggests caution in interpretation. East Asia & Pacific shows the second-highest internal variation (standard deviation = 0.089), while Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia display more consistency across countries (standard deviations of 0.044 and 0.042 respectively).

The patterns across regions show statistically significant differences, particularly between Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia & Pacific. Figure 5.3 visualizes these regional variations, illustrating how discourse centralization differs across geographical areas despite the overall high dominance across all regions.

### The Expectations

Regional patterns in discourse centralization connect to theoretical expectations about the role of regional institutions, knowledge networks, and shared contextual factors in adaptation governance. Several theoretical perspectives informed our expectations regarding regional variations.

The adaptation regime critique would predict some regional variation but would expect these differences to be subordinate to global power dynamics in climate governance. From this perspective, regional patterns might emerge from shared positioning within international political economies rather than from distinct regional epistemologies [@paprocki2018]. This approach would anticipate the highest centralization in regions most dependent on international climate finance and technical assistance.

Conversely, perspectives emphasizing regional knowledge systems and institutional arrangements would expect more pronounced regional differences [@fairhead2003]. This view would suggest that regional bodies like development banks, UN regional offices, and regional political organizations might play significant roles in shaping how adaptation is conceptualized within their regions. Regional scientific networks and shared climatic challenges might also contribute to distinct regional approaches to adaptation.

Our research hypothesis anticipated that regional patterns might be the primary explanatory factor for discourse centralization, potentially surpassing income level. We expected that shared geographical contexts, climate vulnerabilities, and regional institutional arrangements would create distinctive regional approaches to adaptation planning. The finding that regional groupings explain slightly less variance than income level partially challenges this expectation, though the difference is minimal.

### Why It Is Different

The strong explanatory power of regional groupings, nearly equal to income level, suggests that adaptation discourse is significantly shaped by regional dynamics. However, these regional patterns likely reflect institutional arrangements and power relations rather than fundamentally different epistemological approaches to adaptation.

The high discourse centralization in Sub-Saharan Africa may reflect the region's particular positioning within international climate governance. As the region with the highest concentration of Least Developed Countries and significant dependence on international climate finance, Sub-Saharan Africa experiences strong external influences on adaptation planning [@hall2018]. Regional bodies like the African Development Bank and UN Economic Commission for Africa also promote certain approaches to adaptation, potentially contributing to regional convergence. Additionally, many countries in the region receive technical assistance from the same international organizations and consultant groups, creating pathways for discourse homogenization.

The relatively lower centralization in East Asia & Pacific likely reflects the greater diversity of economies and political systems within this region. This regional grouping includes both high-income countries with substantial autonomous policy capacity and low-income countries with greater reliance on international assistance. The region's diverse climatic challenges—from typhoons to sea-level rise to drought—may also contribute to more varied adaptation approaches.

The high internal variation within the Middle East & North Africa suggests significant heterogeneity in how countries in this region approach adaptation planning. This variation may reflect divergent political systems, economic models, and relationships with international climate governance. However, the small sample size for this region suggests caution in interpretation.

Rather than indicating fundamentally different regional epistemologies, these patterns likely reflect how regional institutional arrangements mediate global discourse. Regional development banks, UN regional offices, and regional political organizations often serve as intermediaries between global frameworks and national implementation, translating international concepts into regionally specific applications [@biesbroek2018]. These regional institutions may emphasize certain aspects of adaptation that align with regional priorities while still operating within the broader international adaptation discourse.

The minimal gap between income and region as explanatory factors suggests that these dimensions interact in complex ways. Regional patterns may partly reflect the clustering of countries with similar income levels within regions, as well as shared historical relationships with international development institutions. This interaction between economic categories and regional groupings creates multiple, overlapping influences on how adaptation is conceptualized and articulated in national planning documents.

Contrary to expectations of distinctly different regional epistemologies, the findings suggest that regional variations occur within a relatively homogeneous global discourse on adaptation. Despite some regional differences in emphasis or terminology, the high dominance indices across all regions indicate limited space for fundamentally different approaches to adaptation. This pattern aligns with @eriksen2021's critique of mainstreaming approaches that incorporate adaptation into existing development frameworks without challenging underlying assumptions or power relations.

## Findings Across Geography

### The Findings

Geographical characteristics, specifically whether countries are Small Island Developing States (SIDS) or Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), explain substantially less variance in discourse centralization patterns than either income or region, accounting for only 3.7% of the variance. This finding suggests that shared geographical vulnerabilities have less influence on how countries frame adaptation challenges and solutions than their economic classification or regional affiliation.

The analysis of geographical groupings reveals interesting patterns nonetheless. LLDCs display a very high level of discourse centralization with a dominance index of 0.971 (CI: 0.952-0.990), indicating that adaptation discourse in these countries is highly concentrated around three dominant topics. In contrast, SIDS show a somewhat lower centralization with a dominance index of 0.932 (CI: 0.884-0.981), the second-lowest among all sub-categories examined.

The internal variation within these geographical groups also differs notably. SIDS exhibit relatively high internal variation (standard deviation = 0.082), suggesting diversity in how island states approach adaptation planning despite shared challenges related to sea-level rise and extreme weather events. LLDCs, conversely, show much lower internal variation (standard deviation = 0.030), indicating more consistent discourse patterns across these countries despite their diverse regional contexts.

The difference between SIDS and LLDCs is statistically significant, with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Figure 5.4 visualizes these differences, illustrating how discourse centralization patterns vary between these geographical groupings despite their shared "special status" designation in international climate governance.

### The Expectations

Geographical characteristics shape vulnerability to climate impacts in fundamental ways, creating distinct adaptation challenges for different types of countries. This reality informed our expectations regarding discourse patterns across geographical categories.

Given their distinctive and acute climate vulnerabilities, we anticipated that SIDS might develop particularly distinctive approaches to adaptation, potentially resulting in either higher centralization around island-specific concerns or greater diversity reflecting varied island contexts [@barnett2016]. The existential threat that sea-level rise poses to many island states creates unique pressures and priorities that might shape adaptation discourse in distinctive ways.

Similarly, LLDCs face specific challenges related to their geographical isolation, including limited transportation options, dependence on neighboring countries for market access, and often severe vulnerability to droughts [@peskett2011]. These shared challenges might be expected to create distinctive discourse patterns in their adaptation planning.

More broadly, we expected that countries facing similar geographical challenges might converge around shared conceptualizations of adaptation regardless of their income level or regional affiliation. The finding that geographical characteristics explain substantially less variance than either income or region challenges this expectation, suggesting that economic and institutional factors may outweigh geographical vulnerabilities in shaping adaptation discourse.

### Why It Is Different

The limited explanatory power of geographical characteristics for discourse centralization patterns requires careful interpretation. This finding does not necessarily indicate that geography is irrelevant to adaptation planning, but rather that shared geographical vulnerabilities do not translate into distinctive discourse patterns to the extent we might expect.

The contrast between SIDS and LLDCs is particularly instructive. Despite both groups having special status in international climate governance, they show significantly different patterns of discourse centralization. The lower centralization and higher internal variation among SIDS may reflect several factors. SIDS have been particularly vocal and active in international climate negotiations, often leading advocacy for ambitious climate action [@roberts2015]. This prominent role may provide SIDS with greater agency in shaping their adaptation discourse, enabling more diverse approaches. Additionally, SIDS span multiple regions with different colonial histories, cultural contexts, and governance systems, potentially contributing to more varied adaptation framings.

Conversely, the high centralization and low internal variation among LLDCs may reflect stronger constraints on their adaptation planning. Many LLDCs are low-income countries with limited institutional capacity, creating greater reliance on international frameworks and assistance. Their geographical isolation may also limit their participation in international climate governance, potentially reducing their influence over how adaptation is conceptualized. The concentration of many LLDCs in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia may also contribute to more homogeneous discourse patterns aligned with regional approaches.

The finding that geographical characteristics explain less variance than expected challenges perspectives that emphasize the context-specific nature of adaptation challenges. Despite the distinct vulnerabilities that different geographical settings create, adaptation discourse appears more strongly structured by existing economic and institutional relationships than by shared geographical conditions. This pattern suggests that adaptation planning may not fully reflect local geographical realities, instead conforming to broader development frameworks and institutional expectations.

This finding aligns with critiques of adaptation mainstreaming that emphasize the dominance of international frameworks over context-specific approaches [@schipper2020]. As @fry2019 argues, dominant development discourses can engage in "defuturing" by constraining the imagination of alternative approaches better suited to specific geographical contexts. The relatively low explanatory power of geographical characteristics may reflect this constraining influence of dominant adaptation discourses on how even geographically distinct countries frame their adaptation challenges and solutions.

However, it is important to note that the analysis examines discourse patterns rather than substantive adaptation measures. Countries may implement geographically appropriate adaptation actions while framing these actions in terms that align with dominant international discourse. The gap between discourse and practice in adaptation governance represents an important area for further research that extends beyond the scope of this analysis.
