> Climate adaptation is becoming a central part of development governance, where the goal is to finesse the three pillars to get the optimal political economy outcome.

This chapter examines how climate governance operates through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its three main pillars. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through economic mechanisms like carbon markets and climate finance. Adaptation addresses adjusting to climate impacts, connecting closely with development assistance and aid flows to vulnerable countries. Loss and damage deals with compensating for climate harms that cannot be avoided through mitigation or adaptation, raising questions about responsibility and reparations. Understanding these three pillars - and particularly how adaptation has emerged as a distinct domain of North-South relations - provides essential context for analyzing how countries plan their responses to climate change.

## The UNFCCC: A Political Arena

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, established at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, is fundamentally a political arena where nations engage in struggle over responsibility, resources, and power [@hall2018]. Despite its technical veneer of scientific assessments and economic mechanisms, the UNFCCC represents a site where countries attempt to both achieve as much climate progress as possible while avoiding as much responsibility as possible. The outcomes of this political struggle are shaped not by scientific imperatives alone but by the relative power of different actors and their capacity to define problems and solutions.

Together with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the UNFCCC established new institutional arrangements for addressing global environmental challenges [@hall2018]. But more fundamentally, these frameworks created new vocabularies for continuing old relationships. Where colonial powers once spoke of civilizing missions, development discourse spoke of modernization. Now climate governance speaks of adaptation, but the underlying structure persists: Northern expertise addressing Southern deficiency.

The UNFCCC serves as the arena where everyone connected to climate work congregates - consultants, politicians, NGOs, businesses, and bureaucrats [@defrancesco2020]. This creates powerful epistemic communities that shape how climate challenges are understood and addressed. The same networks that once promoted structural adjustment now advocate climate finance. The same consulting firms that implemented development projects now design adaptation plans. The institutional continuity reveals climate governance as extending rather than replacing previous forms of North-South relations.

The UNFCCC operates on what might be called "bathtub logic" - a linear understanding where greenhouse gas emissions lead to climate change, which leads to environmental impacts, which cause damages. This seemingly neutral framework structures all climate governance around three sequential responses: mitigation (reducing emissions to prevent climate change), adaptation (adjusting to unavoidable impacts), and loss and damage (compensating for unavoidable harms). But this technical framing obscures profound political implications.

The bathtub metaphor itself reveals the limitations of this approach. Climate change is not simply a matter of emissions flowing into an atmospheric container until it overflows. The metaphor eliminates questions of power, justice, and structural inequality by reducing complex social-ecological relationships to hydraulic engineering. Who controls the taps? Who bears the costs when the tub overflows? Who decides acceptable water levels? These questions cannot be answered through technical assessment alone.

Within this framework, mitigation appears as the primary response - turning off the taps to prevent overflow. Adaptation becomes a secondary measure for dealing with water already in the tub. Loss and damage emerges as compensation when the tub overflows despite other measures. This hierarchy is not neutral but serves particular interests. For Northern countries with high historical emissions, mitigation implies expensive economic transformation. For Southern countries facing climate impacts, adaptation provides a way to appear helpful while avoiding responsibility for the overflow.

The UNFCCC's evolution through these three pillars - mitigation established at Kyoto (1997), adaptation formalized at Cancun (2010), and loss and damage incorporated in Paris (2015) - reflects growing recognition of climate impacts and the inadequacy of mitigation alone [@roberts2015]. But it also reveals shifting North-South dynamics where each new pillar serves as what might be termed a "side payment" - compensation offered to maintain consensus while avoiding fundamental changes to the global economic order.

Everything that is not mitigation becomes, in effect, a mechanism for managing the politics of inadequate climate action. Adaptation finance promises to help Southern countries prepare for climate impacts while Northern countries continue emitting. Loss and damage funds offer future compensation while avoiding present liability. The result is a system that appears to address climate injustice while carefully preserving the arrangements that produce it.

## Mitigation

Climate mitigation emerged as the first pillar of climate governance, establishing North-South power dynamics through differential responsibilities that would later shape adaptation approaches. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries, with an average reduction of 5.2% from 1990 levels to be achieved by 2012 [@hall2018]. This approach established a key North-South dynamic: developed countries would take the lead in emissions reductions, while developing countries were granted space to pursue economic development without binding emissions targets.

The Protocol created market mechanisms for carbon trading through "flexibility mechanisms" - Emissions Trading, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation [@peskett2011]. The CDM became a significant channel for North-South cooperation, allowing developed countries to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries and earn certified emission reduction credits. Through these mechanisms, developing countries under no obligation to cut emissions could sell carbon credits to industrialized nations with reduction obligations [@peskett2011].

However, the geographic distribution of CDM projects revealed how market-based approaches reproduced existing inequalities. The majority concentrated in larger emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil, while least developed countries, particularly in Africa, hosted relatively few projects [@peskett2011]. This pattern showed how carbon markets reinforced global investment patterns, excluding the poorest countries despite their greater vulnerability to climate impacts [@dunlap2018].

The expansion of climate finance and market mechanisms has created new forms of what scholars term "green colonialism" - the appropriation of land and resources in the Global South for Northern climate goals [@dunlap2018]. Wind energy projects in Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec, marketed as climate solutions, have displaced indigenous communities and disrupted traditional livelihoods [@dunlap2018]. Carbon credit plantations in Uganda have enclosed communal lands, forcing pastoralists off territories they have managed for generations. Even in Norway, wind farms on SÃ¡mi reindeer herding territories represent the continuation of colonial practices through environmental justifications.

These examples reveal how climate mitigation creates new "sacrifice zones" - places rendered disposable for the greater good of climate action [@tornel2024; @wilhite2019]. Communities that contributed least to climate change bear the costs of mitigation projects designed to enable continued consumption in high-emitting countries. The logic mirrors earlier extractive relationships where Southern resources served Northern development, now repackaged as global environmental necessity.

Climate finance represents the latest iteration of development finance, promising to mobilize private capital for environmental goals [@buchner2023; @stern2022]. The idea of blended finance - combining public resources to leverage private investment - echoes decades of similar promises in development assistance. Yet this approach fundamentally misunderstands the problem of climate change as a shortage of capital rather than a political struggle over how capital is allocated.

The problem of climate mitigation is essentially political-economic, not developmental. Every dollar spent represents a choice - shift spending to less polluting sectors through tax and emissions trading systems, shift spenders from private consumption to public care [@foller2024], or simply spend less through degrowth approaches. From this perspective, the world continues spending vastly more on fossil fuel subsidies than on climate solutions, making the transition financially feasible if politically difficult.

Climate finance discourse resembles the economic shock therapy of the 2000s, promising rapid societal transformation through market mechanisms [@mazzucato2021; @bastani2019; @vettese2022; @raworth2017]. Yet this technical framing obscures fundamental questions: Why should Southern countries restructure their economies for climate goals when Northern countries resist changing their own? Modern Monetary Theory and alternative economic frameworks demonstrate that the financial barriers to climate action are largely constructed rather than natural [@kelton2020].

The Paris Agreement marked a shift from binding obligations to voluntary "nationally determined contributions," introducing a universal framework where all countries contribute while maintaining differential responsibilities [@hall2018]. This flexibility came at the cost of ambition, with initial NDCs putting the world on track for approximately 3Â°C of warming rather than the Agreement's 1.5-2Â°C goal. This ambition gap reinforces critiques that the climate regime prioritizes political feasibility over transformative action [@williams2020].

International cooperation through climate finance flows ($100 billion promised at Copenhagen 2009, $300 billion pledged at COP29 2024) appears substantial but remains marginal compared to global fossil fuel investments. The larger question is whether climate finance represents genuine cooperation or a mechanism for maintaining Northern control over Southern development pathways while appearing to address climate justice.

## Adaptation

As Kyoto's mitigation targets proved inadequate and governments faced resistance to ambitious measures, climate adaptation gradually gained prominence [@roberts2018]. This shift emerged from recognition that even with ambitious mitigation, some climate impacts were occurring and others were inevitable. But adaptation's elevation to a central pillar reflects more than scientific necessity - it represents the continuation of development discourse through climate vocabulary.

The Cancun Adaptation Framework (2010) formally established adaptation as the second pillar, creating the Adaptation Committee, National Adaptation Plans process, and approaches to address loss and damage [@mizuno2024]. These mechanisms established institutional arrangements that would shape North-South relations in adaptation governance, with developed countries providing finance that developing countries could access through specific procedures and criteria.

Climate adaptation operates through a fundamental reconceptualization of Southern societies from "underdeveloped" to "vulnerable." Where development discourse constructed the Third World as lacking capital, technology, and institutions, adaptation discourse constructs these same countries as vulnerable to floods, droughts, and climate change [@escobar1995]. This shift maintains the structural relationship while updating the vocabulary: countries requiring external intervention, incapable of managing their own futures, needing Northern expertise and financial resources.

Vulnerability manifests differently across contexts, revealing the political nature of these constructions. In industrialized countries, adaptation focuses on managing infrastructure and adjusting systems to changing conditions [@hall2018]. In developing countries, adaptation intersects with broader development challenges - poverty reduction, food security, disaster risk reduction, public health. The boundaries between adaptation and development blur, leading to debates about "adaptation mainstreaming" versus transformative approaches [@ireland2013].

These different conceptualizations reflect underlying North-South dynamics. Northern adaptation appears as technical adjustment to climate parameters. Southern adaptation becomes development intervention addressing comprehensive social vulnerability [@scoville-simonds2020]. This framing simultaneously reflects and reinforces power dynamics where Northern institutions define legitimate adaptation and appropriate implementation methods.

The adaptation funding landscape materializes these relations through institutional arrangements and power dynamics. The Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund, Special Climate Change Fund, and Green Climate Fund create complex architectures where adaptation finance consistently lags behind mitigation finance [@persson2014]. Despite the Green Climate Fund's mandate to balance funding, achieving this balance remains elusive in practice.

Adaptation funding faces unique challenges absent in mitigation. Unlike emissions reductions, which provide common metrics, adaptation lacks universally agreed measures of effectiveness [@persson2014]. This measurement challenge is not merely technical but reflects deeper questions about what constitutes successful adaptation and who defines success. These definitional struggles shape resource allocation and ultimately determine whose adaptation is supported.

### Maladaptation and the Limits of Technical Solutions

The emergence of "maladaptation" as a policy concern reveals fundamental tensions in adaptation approaches [@schipper2020; @eriksen2021]. Maladaptive interventions increase vulnerability rather than reducing it, often through projects that appear technically sound but ignore social and political contexts. Coastal protection that displaces flooding to poorer communities, drought-resistant seeds that create farmer dependence on corporations, early warning systems that reach connected populations while missing marginalized groups - all represent maladaptation that serves some interests while harming others.

Maladaptation reveals how technical framings of adaptation can obscure political dimensions. When interventions increase inequality, concentrate resources among elites, or eliminate livelihood options for vulnerable populations, the problem is not poor implementation but fundamental contradictions in adaptation approaches that ignore power relations [@eriksen2021]. This connects to Ferguson's analysis of development as moving through historical phases - from God to Empire to Development, now to Adaptation [@ferguson1994]. Each phase promises transformation while maintaining underlying relations of control.

We are adapting to climate change for the rest of our lives, as we have been developing before, and civilizing before that. Adaptation risks becoming the new default way of observing and intervening in the world. The same institutional apparatus that promoted development now advocates adaptation, using similar frameworks, employing similar experts, and producing similar relationships of dependence.

The side-payment dimension operates both internationally and domestically. Internationally, adaptation finance compensates for inadequate mitigation while maintaining Northern emissions. Domestically, adaptation discourse enables continued resource extraction by promising to "adapt away" environmental damages. Norwegian oil exploration becomes more politically feasible when coupled with promises of adaptation assistance to affected countries.

The adaptation governance landscape's multi-level nature - requiring action at global, regional, national, and local scales - creates challenges for coherence while enabling institutional control. International frameworks provide guidance and resources, but adaptation's context-specific character requires localized assessment and response [@ireland2010]. This tension between global standardization and local specificity enables Northern-dominated institutions to establish frameworks while claiming to support local autonomy.

## Loss and Damage

Loss and damage emerged as the third pillar recognizing that some climate impacts exceed adaptation limits, particularly for the most vulnerable nations [@roberts2015]. The concept's development reveals contested politics of climate responsibility and liability, from the Alliance of Small Island States' 1991 proposal for international insurance to the Warsaw International Mechanism (2013) and incorporation into the Paris Agreement (2015) [@toussaint2021].

This twenty-four-year struggle reflects persistent resistance from developed countries concerned about liability claims, with the United States explicitly insisting that Paris Agreement Article 8 "does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation" [@vanhala2016]. The careful exclusion of liability language reveals how climate governance manages justice claims while avoiding fundamental challenges to existing arrangements.

Loss and damage operates through a temporal displacement that complicates traditional transitional justice frameworks. Where transitional justice typically addresses past harms through truth, reconciliation, and reparations, loss and damage addresses future harms while avoiding acknowledgment of past responsibility. This temporal confusion enables developed countries to provide "support" for future climate impacts while denying liability for historical emissions that cause these impacts.

The conceptual framing reveals this evasion. Loss and damage can be understood legally - calculating damages, establishing climate attribution, assigning responsibility, and providing compensation [@wallimann-helmer2023]. Alternatively, it can be framed as risk management - reducing risk through adaptation, transferring risk through insurance, and managing residual risk through resilience measures [@mechler2020]. The legal framing challenges existing power relations by asserting accountability, while the risk management framing depoliticizes loss and damage as technical challenge.

These competing framings reflect fundamental tensions regarding climate responsibility. The compensation approach directly challenges conventional development frameworks by asserting that historical emitters bear responsibility for climate damages [@vanhala2016]. The risk management approach, while less politically contentious, may depoliticize loss and damage by shifting focus from responsibility to technical solutions, potentially reinforcing existing power dynamics.

Loss and damage governance creates what might be termed a "victim trap" where countries must perform their vulnerability to access resources [@dvorak2018; @krystalli2021]. This performance requires demonstrating both current suffering and future helplessness - positioning entire nations as climate victims requiring external assistance. Yet some countries resist this characterization, seeking to maintain agency while acknowledging vulnerability [@nakate2021; @brun2016; @ourbak2018; @corbett2020; @carter2020].

The Marshall Islands exemplifies these contradictions. As a small island state facing existential threats from sea-level rise, RMI has become a powerful advocate for climate action and loss and damage provisions [@mcclain2020; @kirsch2020]. Yet this advocacy requires constantly performing vulnerability while simultaneously demonstrating capacity to participate in complex international negotiations [@corbett2020]. The country must appear both helpless enough to deserve assistance and capable enough to manage it effectively.

The adaptation frontier is technologically bounded, meaning theoretically everything could be adapted given sufficient finance, political will, and social acceptance. The question becomes opportunity cost - what societies are willing to sacrifice to maintain particular arrangements under changing conditions. Loss and damage emerges where these costs become unacceptable, but who determines acceptability remains contested.

The breakthrough at COP27 establishing loss and damage funding arrangements, followed by operationalization at COP28, represents significant progress [@janzen2021]. Initial pledges of approximately $700 million appear substantial until compared with estimated loss and damage costs of $290-580 billion annually by 2030 for developing countries alone. The recent COP29 commitment of $300 billion annually by 2035 suggests increasing recognition while remaining far below assessed needs.

These funding commitments operate as the ultimate side payment - appearing to address climate justice while maintaining fundamental arrangements. Loss and damage finance enables continued Northern emissions by providing compensation for resulting damages. Countries can continue extraction and consumption while paying for adaptation and loss and damage in affected regions. This transforms moral and political obligations into voluntary financial transactions.

The institutional architecture for loss and damage - like adaptation before it - channels resources through state bureaucracies and international mechanisms that may have limited connection to affected communities. Complex eligibility criteria, reporting requirements, and evaluation procedures ensure that loss and damage finance serves institutional needs while potentially missing those most harmed by climate impacts.

The evolution of loss and damage from activist demand to institutional mechanism illustrates how the UNFCCC system manages justice claims. By incorporating loss and damage into formal governance structures, the system appears responsive to demands for climate justice while constraining how these demands can be articulated and addressed. Future damages become manageable through risk assessment and insurance mechanisms, while historical responsibility disappears into technical discussions of attribution and causation.

Loss and damage governance reveals how climate institutions manage time to avoid fundamental challenges. By focusing on future harms, the framework avoids addressing present injustices. By emphasizing technical attribution, it delays political acknowledgment of responsibility. By promising future funding, it defers immediate action on structural causes.

This temporal management serves multiple functions. For developed countries, it transforms historical responsibility into future assistance - moral obligations become voluntary contributions. For developing countries, it provides hope for resources while maintaining eligibility for other funding streams. For international institutions, it creates new mandates and funding flows while avoiding disruptive political confrontations.

Yet this temporal displacement may ultimately undermine loss and damage's transformative potential. By separating future compensation from present responsibility, the framework enables continued practices that create loss and damage while providing mechanisms to manage their consequences. This represents the ultimate achievement of the UNFCCC's political character - transforming demands for justice into technical problems of risk management and resource allocation.

The climate governance system that emerges from this political arena serves particular interests while claiming to serve universal ones. Understanding this system's operation - how it transforms political questions into technical problems, how it manages justice claims without addressing structural causes, how it maintains North-South relations while promising transformation - provides essential context for examining how adaptation planning functions within these broader dynamics.
