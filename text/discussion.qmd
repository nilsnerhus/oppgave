> The high centralization of adaptation discourse around income-based patterns provides empirical evidence for the adaptation regime critique, showing how adaptation constructs vulnerability in ways that mirror development's construction of underdevelopment and functions as an anti-politics machine.

The findings presented in the previous chapter reveal a striking centralization of adaptation discourse across National Adaptation Plans, with income level emerging as the primary explanatory factor for what variation does exist. This chapter discusses the theoretical implications of these findings, particularly how they relate to critical perspectives on adaptation governance. I argue that the empirical evidence of high discourse centralization along income lines provides substantive support for the adaptation regime critique, demonstrating how adaptation discourse functions in ways that parallel broader critiques of development discourse.

The remarkably high Dominance Index (0.949) indicates that despite the diverse geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic contexts in which climate adaptation occurs, official adaptation discourse as expressed in NAPs remains highly homogeneous. This homogeneity suggests not simply coincidental similarity but active processes of discourse centralization operating through institutional arrangements, knowledge production, and power relations in climate governance. The finding that income level explains more variance than either region or geography further suggests that adaptation discourse is structured primarily along existing development categories rather than in response to specific climate vulnerabilities.

These patterns provide empirical evidence for theoretical arguments advanced by scholars like Paprocki [@paprocki2018] and Dewan [@dewan2022], who have argued that adaptation functions as a regime that constructs vulnerability in particular ways while foreclosing alternative understandings and approaches. The following sections explore three key implications of these findings: how adaptation discourse constructs climate vulnerability, how adaptation governance functions as an anti-politics machine, and possibilities for more epistemologically diverse approaches to adaptation.

## The Construction of Climate Vulnerability

> Adaptation discourse actively constructs rather than merely responds to climate vulnerability, paralleling how development discourse produced underdevelopment as its necessary counterpart as evidenced by discourse centralization patterns along income lines.

The high centralization of adaptation discourse around income-based patterns reveals how vulnerability is not simply an objective condition that adaptation responds to, but an actively constructed category that emerges through discourse and practice. This parallels Escobar's [@escobar1995] argument that development discourse did not simply address pre-existing underdevelopment but actively produced "the Third World" as its necessary counterpart through particular knowledge practices, institutional arrangements, and power relations.

The finding that adaptation discourse clusters more strongly by income level than by geography suggests that vulnerability is conceptualized primarily in economic terms, with countries positioned similarly in the global economic system conceptualizing adaptation in similar ways despite facing different climate hazards. This economic framing of vulnerability aligns with mainstream development discourse that positions economic growth and market integration as universal solutions regardless of context [@ferguson1994].

The particularly high centralization (0.980) and low internal variation (0.018) among low-income countries suggests stronger constraints on their discursive autonomy in adaptation planning. This pattern indicates what Paprocki [@paprocki2018] describes as "anticipatory ruination," where certain places are constructed as inherently vulnerable and therefore requiring particular kinds of interventions. The discourse of inevitable climate catastrophe in low-income countries creates conditions where almost any intervention can be justified as necessary adaptation, regardless of its actual effects on vulnerability.

Content analysis of the dominant topics in NAPs across income groups reveals how different aspects of vulnerability are emphasized or marginalized depending on economic positioning. Low-income country NAPs emphasize vulnerability as lack of capacity, resources, and institutions—aligning with traditional development narratives that position underdevelopment as absence or lack rather than as actively produced condition. Higher-income country NAPs emphasize vulnerability as technical challenge requiring scientific expertise and technological solutions, positioning these countries as sources of knowledge and innovation rather than sites of fundamental vulnerability.

These patterns of differential vulnerability construction reflect what Santos [@santos2014] describes as "epistemicide"—the systematic exclusion of non-Western knowledge systems from legitimate discourse. The high centralization of adaptation discourse suggests limited space for alternative conceptualizations of vulnerability rooted in indigenous knowledge, local experience, or non-Western ontologies. Even when local knowledge is referenced in NAPs, it is typically framed as data to be incorporated into expert-driven frameworks rather than as alternative epistemological systems that might fundamentally challenge dominant approaches.

The construction of climate vulnerability through adaptation discourse has material consequences for how resources are allocated and interventions designed. When vulnerability is primarily understood through economic frameworks, adaptation resources flow toward approaches that align with existing development paradigms rather than potentially transformative alternatives [@eriksen2021]. This reinforces existing power relations and may exacerbate rather than reduce vulnerability in the most marginalized communities.

The findings suggest that vulnerability construction occurs not only through direct claims about who or what is vulnerable, but through more subtle discursive processes that shape what counts as valid knowledge about vulnerability, who is authorized to produce that knowledge, and what interventions are considered appropriate responses. The remarkable consistency of discourse across diverse contexts indicates that these processes operate at a global scale, with powerful institutional actors including multilateral development banks, donor agencies, and scientific bodies shaping how vulnerability is understood and addressed.

## The Anti-Politics of Adaptation

> Adaptation governance functions as an anti-politics machine that transforms fundamentally political questions about climate justice into technical problems, depoliticizing vulnerability while expanding bureaucratic power across governance scales.

The high centralization of adaptation discourse provides empirical evidence for what Ferguson [@ferguson1994] termed the "anti-politics machine" operating in climate adaptation governance. The anti-politics machine transforms fundamentally political questions about power, justice, and distribution into technical problems amenable to expert solutions, depoliticizing vulnerability while simultaneously expanding bureaucratic power across multiple governance scales.

The finding that NAPs across diverse contexts employ remarkably similar framing, methodology, and proposed solutions suggests a standardized technical approach to adaptation that obscures its inherently political nature. Content analysis reveals that governance, institutional arrangements, and technical capacity building feature prominently across the corpus, while structural causes of vulnerability related to global political economy, colonialism, or power relations are largely absent or marginalized. This technical framing effectively depoliticizes adaptation, positioning it as a matter of proper planning and implementation rather than transforming the systems that produce vulnerability in the first place.

The dominance of particular topics across NAPs—vulnerability assessment, climate modeling, project management frameworks, monitoring and evaluation systems—reflects what Li [@ferguson1994] describes as "rendering technical," where complex political-economic realities are translated into technical problems requiring technocratic interventions. This technical rendering makes climate adaptation governable through particular institutional arrangements but simultaneously limits the scope of what counts as legitimate adaptation action.

Our finding that income level explains more variance than geographical factors directly supports Ferguson's argument that development interventions (including adaptation) often have less to do with their stated objectives than with expanding bureaucratic state power. The similarity of discourse across countries with different climate vulnerabilities but similar income levels suggests that adaptation planning may be shaped more by institutional imperatives and funding requirements than by context-specific needs. This aligns with critical analyses of adaptation as primarily serving bureaucratic rather than vulnerability reduction objectives [@dewan2022].

The anti-politics of adaptation operates differently across income groups, reflecting distinct forms of depoliticization. In low-income contexts, adaptation discourse emphasizes capacity building and institutional strengthening, positioning vulnerability primarily as a governance gap rather than a consequence of global political-economic relations. In middle-income contexts, adaptation is framed as an opportunity for sustainable development and economic transformation, obscuring questions about who benefits from such transformation. In high-income contexts, adaptation becomes primarily a technical challenge of infrastructure adjustment and risk management, removing questions of historical responsibility and climate justice from consideration.

Regional patterns in discourse centralization suggest that the anti-politics machine operates across multiple scales, with regional bodies mediating between global frameworks and national implementation. The finding that regional groupings explain substantial variance indicates that regional institutions play an important role in translating global adaptation frameworks into context-specific approaches. However, the still-high centralization within regions suggests that these institutions often reproduce rather than challenge the depoliticizing tendencies of global adaptation discourse.

The institutionalization of adaptation through NAPs themselves represents a form of anti-politics, creating standardized planning frameworks that privilege certain forms of knowledge and expertise while marginalizing others. The UNFCCC guidelines for NAP development, technical assistance from international organizations, and funding criteria all shape what counts as legitimate adaptation planning, potentially constraining the autonomy of national governments and communities in determining their own adaptation priorities [@mizuno2024].

However, the variation that does exist across the corpus suggests that the anti-politics of adaptation is neither absolute nor uncontested. The lower centralization in some regions and income groups indicates spaces where alternative framings and approaches might emerge, even within the constraints of global adaptation governance. These variations point to what Scott calls "weapons of the weak"—subtle forms of resistance that operate within dominant systems while creating space for alternative possibilities [@ferguson1994].

## Toward Pluriversal Adaptation

> The empirical evidence of high discourse centralization calls for pluriversal approaches to adaptation governance that create space for diverse epistemologies while still enabling coordination necessary for effective climate action.

The findings on discourse centralization present both a challenge and an opportunity for reimagining adaptation governance. The challenge lies in the current homogeneity of adaptation discourse, which limits the range of approaches considered legitimate and marginalizes alternative knowledge systems that might offer valuable insights for addressing climate vulnerability. The opportunity lies in identifying pathways toward more epistemologically diverse approaches that Escobar [@escobar2018] describes as "pluriversal"—creating space for multiple ways of knowing and being while still enabling the coordination necessary for effective climate action.

The concept of a pluriversal approach to adaptation resonates with Santos' [@santos2014] call for an "ecology of knowledges" that recognizes the partial and situated nature of all knowledge systems and seeks productive dialogue between them. Rather than privileging scientific and technical knowledge as inherently superior, an ecology of knowledges would recognize the value of indigenous, local, and experiential knowledge in understanding and addressing climate vulnerability. The finding that geographical factors explain relatively little variance in current adaptation discourse suggests significant untapped potential for approaches that more fully engage with place-based knowledge systems.

Regional variations in discourse centralization provide potential starting points for developing more pluriversal approaches. The lower centralization in regions like East Asia and Pacific (0.924) and Latin America and Caribbean (0.941) suggests these regions may already be incorporating somewhat more diverse approaches than the global average. Examining the specific discursive practices and institutional arrangements in these contexts might offer insights into how greater epistemological diversity could be fostered within adaptation governance more broadly.

A pluriversal approach to adaptation would require fundamental changes in how adaptation is governed, financed, and implemented. Current institutional arrangements—including the NAP process itself—often incentivize standardization rather than diversity, with funding mechanisms and technical assistance structured around particular conceptions of what constitutes legitimate adaptation. Reforming these arrangements to create space for diverse epistemologies would involve rethinking how adaptation is defined, valued, and evaluated across governance scales [@ireland2013].

Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems offer particularly important resources for pluriversal adaptation, providing alternative conceptualizations of human-environment relationships and approaches to navigating environmental change. While these knowledge systems are increasingly acknowledged in adaptation discourse, they are typically treated as sources of data to be incorporated into dominant frameworks rather than as alternative epistemological systems that might fundamentally challenge those frameworks. A genuinely pluriversal approach would engage with indigenous knowledge on its own terms, recognizing its distinct ontological and epistemological foundations [@escobar2020].

Community-based adaptation represents another potential pathway toward greater epistemological diversity, creating space for local knowledge and priorities in adaptation planning and implementation. However, as Ireland and McKinnon [@ireland2013] argue, community-based approaches often remain constrained by broader institutional frameworks that determine what counts as legitimate adaptation. A pluriversal approach would require challenging these constraints to create genuine space for community-defined adaptation pathways.

Regional institutions could play a crucial role in fostering pluriversal adaptation, mediating between global frameworks and local implementation in ways that create space for context-specific approaches. The finding that regional groupings explain significant variance in discourse centralization suggests that regional bodies already influence how adaptation is conceptualized and implemented. Strengthening regional institutions that are more responsive to local contexts and knowledge systems could help create pathways toward greater epistemological diversity within adaptation governance.

Crucially, a pluriversal approach to adaptation does not mean abandoning coordination or coherence in climate action. Rather, it means reimagining how that coordination happens—moving from standardization that privileges particular knowledge systems toward dialogical approaches that enable conversation across different ways of knowing and being. This aligns with what Escobar [@escobar2018] describes as "autonomous design," where communities design their own transitions based on their specific contexts, histories, and aspirations, while still engaging with broader networks of knowledge and practice.

The high discourse centralization documented in this research represents not just a problem to be solved but an opportunity to reimagine adaptation governance in ways that better serve diverse communities facing climate impacts. By challenging the current homogeneity of adaptation discourse and creating space for epistemological diversity, pluriversal approaches to adaptation could enable more just and effective responses to climate vulnerability across contexts.
