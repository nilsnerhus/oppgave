# Discussion: Discourse Centralization and Adaptation Governance

The empirical findings presented in the previous chapter reveal a striking pattern: adaptation discourse in National Adaptation Plans is highly centralized across all dimensions examined, with minimal variation between different country groupings. The overall Dominance Index of 0.949 indicates that just three topics dominate nearly 95% of the discourse across the entire corpus. While some variation exists between different income groups, regions, and geographical categories, these differences occur within an overwhelmingly homogeneous global discourse on adaptation.

Perhaps most notably, income level emerges as the primary explanatory factor for the patterns observed, narrowly surpassing regional groupings (8.1% versus 8.0% of variance explained). This finding suggests that adaptation discourse follows existing development categories more closely than it reflects distinct regional knowledge systems or geographical vulnerabilities. Low-income countries display both the highest discourse centralization (0.980) and the lowest internal variation (standard deviation = 0.018), indicating remarkable conformity in how these countries conceptualize adaptation despite diverse contexts.

These patterns of discourse centralization can be illuminated through the lens of post-development critique. Just as development discourse did not simply discover but actively produced "underdevelopment" as its necessary counterpart [@escobar1995], adaptation discourse does not merely respond to pre-existing climate vulnerability but constructs specific forms of vulnerability that legitimize particular interventions. The high degree of discourse centralization observed across National Adaptation Plans suggests that adaptation functions as an extension of development logic rather than a transformation of it, with similar epistemological assumptions and power dynamics shaping how climate challenges are understood and addressed.

This chapter applies this theoretical lens to the empirical findings, examining how adaptation discourse constructs climate vulnerability, functions as an "anti-politics machine," shapes temporal and scalar dimensions of climate governance, and what implications these patterns have for more just and effective adaptation approaches.

## The Construction of Climate Vulnerability

The high Dominance Index values across all country groupings provide empirical evidence for a standardized construction of climate vulnerability that parallels what [@escobar1995] identified in development discourse. Just as development discourse produced "the Third World" as an object of knowledge and intervention, adaptation discourse constructs climate vulnerability in ways that make certain forms of knowledge and intervention appear necessary and legitimate while marginalizing alternatives.

The finding that income level explains more variance than either region or geography is particularly revealing about how vulnerability is constructed. The strong relationship between economic categories and discourse patterns suggests that adaptation planning remains firmly embedded within existing development paradigms, despite rhetoric about context-specific approaches. As [@scoville-simonds2020] argue, adaptation mainstreaming often reproduces rather than challenges dominant development frameworks, limiting the space for alternative epistemologies and approaches.

The exceptionally high discourse centralization in low-income countries (0.980) with minimal internal variation (0.018) suggests that these countries face the strongest pressures to conform to dominant constructions of vulnerability. This pattern likely reflects power dynamics in international climate finance, where low-income countries depend heavily on external funding and technical assistance for adaptation planning. As [@dewan2022] observed in Bangladesh, climate adaptation often functions merely as "spice" added to conventional development projects to attract funding, rather than catalyzing fundamentally different approaches based on local knowledge systems and priorities.

The slightly lower centralization in lower-middle income countries (0.928) with higher internal variation (0.094) suggests that these countries may occupy a transitional space with greater capacity to resist standardized vulnerability constructions while still engaging with international frameworks. This finding aligns with [@paprocki2018]'s analysis of adaptation as a regime that operates differently across contexts while maintaining underlying power dynamics that privilege certain forms of knowledge and intervention.

These patterns reflect deeper epistemological assumptions about vulnerability embedded in dominant discourse. The convergence around a limited set of topics across diverse contexts suggests what [@santos2014] terms "epistemicide"—the systematic marginalization of non-Western knowledge systems in favor of dominant epistemological frameworks. Despite the diverse contexts in which adaptation occurs, NAPs display remarkable homogeneity in how they conceptualize adaptation challenges and solutions, suggesting limited space for diverse ways of knowing climate vulnerability.

This construction of vulnerability through standardized discourse has material consequences. When vulnerability is constructed primarily through technocratic and economic frameworks, responses tend to focus on technical adjustments and market-based solutions rather than addressing underlying power relationships and structural causes [@eriksen2021]. The high centralization of discourse around income-based patterns suggests that adaptation planning constructs vulnerability in ways that align with existing development categories and interventions, despite the potentially distinct nature of climate challenges in different contexts.

## The Anti-Politics Machine of Adaptation

The patterns of discourse centralization revealed in this analysis suggest that adaptation governance functions as what [@ferguson1994] termed an "anti-politics machine" in his critique of development interventions. Just as Ferguson documented how development projects in Lesotho transformed political questions about poverty and inequality into technical problems requiring technical solutions, adaptation discourse converts fundamentally political questions about climate justice and responsibility into technical problems of risk management and capacity building.

This depoliticization is evident in the high discourse centralization across all dimensions examined. By converging around a limited set of topics and frameworks, adaptation discourse establishes boundaries around what can be legitimately discussed and proposed, effectively sidelining more political approaches that might challenge underlying power structures. As [@scoville-simonds2020] argue, this "mainstreaming" of adaptation into existing development frameworks often reinforces rather than challenges the power dynamics that produce vulnerability in the first place.

The finding that income level explains the greatest proportion of variance in discourse patterns provides empirical evidence for [@paprocki2018]'s concept of the "adaptation regime"—a configuration of power that governs how adaptation is conceptualized and implemented across different contexts. Despite the rhetoric of country-driven and context-specific approaches, the high discourse centralization in low-income countries suggests that adaptation planning remains significantly constrained by the expectations and requirements of international donors and institutions.

This anti-politics machine operates through what [@paprocki2018] terms "anticipatory ruination"—processes that render certain places as already lost to climate change, justifying interventions that might otherwise face resistance. The high centralization of adaptation discourse suggests limited space for contesting these anticipatory narratives or imagining alternative futures. Instead, NAPs largely reproduce standardized frameworks that naturalize certain development pathways while rendering alternatives unthinkable.

The "climate change as spice" phenomenon identified by [@dewan2022] is likewise reflected in the discourse patterns observed. The high dominance indices across all categories suggest that adaptation discourse often functions as a new justification for conventional development interventions rather than catalyzing fundamentally different approaches. By framing existing development activities as adaptation, this discourse obscures the potential contradictions between conventional development pathways and genuine climate resilience.

These patterns align with [@ferguson1994]'s observation that development interventions often "fail forward"—while not achieving their stated objectives, they successfully expand bureaucratic state power and depoliticize poverty by rendering it a technical problem rather than a political one. Similarly, adaptation discourse may function to expand the reach of international governance while depoliticizing climate vulnerability by framing it primarily as a technical challenge requiring expert intervention rather than a political condition requiring structural transformation.

## Scale, Temporality, and Defuturing in Adaptation Governance

The nearly equal explanatory power of income level (8.1%) and regional groupings (8.0%) for discourse centralization patterns reveals the complex interplay between different scales in adaptation governance. Rather than reflecting either purely global or purely local dynamics, adaptation discourse appears shaped by multiple, overlapping scales of influence that interact in complex ways.

This interaction between scales reflects what [@macginty2015] terms "critical localism" in his analysis of peacebuilding interventions. Just as local peacebuilding is shaped by both global frameworks and local conditions, adaptation discourse reflects a "glocalized" process where global categories and regional institutions jointly shape how adaptation is conceptualized across different contexts. The empirical findings support this perspective, showing how adaptation discourse reflects both global development categories and regional institutional arrangements simultaneously.

However, the high dominance indices across all regions (ranging from 0.919 to 0.969) suggest that regional variations occur within a relatively homogeneous global discourse. Despite some regional differences in emphasis or terminology, the consistently high centralization indicates limited space for fundamentally different approaches to adaptation across regions. This pattern suggests that regional institutions may function more as conduits for global discourse than as channels for distinctly regional or local epistemologies.

The limited explanatory power of geographical characteristics (3.7%) further suggests that adaptation discourse does not strongly reflect local geographical contexts or vulnerabilities. Despite the distinct challenges faced by countries with different geographical features, their adaptation discourse appears more strongly shaped by economic and institutional factors than by local environmental conditions. This finding challenges perspectives that emphasize the context-specific nature of adaptation and suggests that local knowledge and priorities may be marginalized in formal adaptation planning.

These scalar politics have important implications for the temporal dimensions of adaptation planning. The high centralization of discourse across all dimensions suggests what [@fry2019] calls "defuturing"—the active reduction of possible futures through discourses that naturalize certain development pathways while rendering alternatives unthinkable. When adaptation is framed primarily through technocratic and market-based approaches, deeper questions about systemic causes of vulnerability are sidelined, and the imagination of alternative futures is constrained.

These temporal constraints align with what [@goode2017] term "capitalist realism" in their analysis of future imaginaries. By privileging certain ways of knowing and being while marginalizing others, adaptation discourse limits the imagination of alternative futures that might better address the root causes of vulnerability. The empirical evidence of high discourse centralization across all dimensions provides concrete support for this theoretical critique, showing how adaptation planning operates within a narrow conceptual space despite the diversity of contexts it aims to address.

## Toward Pluriversal Adaptation? Implications for Governance

The empirical findings on discourse centralization have significant implications for adaptation governance and North-South relations more broadly. The high dominance indices across all categories suggest a fundamental tension between the standardization needed for global coordination and the epistemological diversity needed for context-appropriate adaptation. Addressing this tension requires rethinking institutional arrangements, funding mechanisms, and knowledge practices in adaptation governance.

The finding that income level explains the greatest proportion of variance in discourse patterns suggests the need to critically examine how development frameworks shape adaptation approaches. As [@ireland2013] argue, truly transformative adaptation may require breaking with conventional development paradigms rather than simply mainstreaming adaptation into existing approaches. This might involve creating institutional spaces where alternative epistemologies and ontologies can inform adaptation planning, rather than imposing standardized frameworks regardless of context.

What might a more pluriversal approach to adaptation look like? [@escobar2018] offers the concept of "designs for the pluriverse" as an alternative to universalizing development models. Applied to adaptation, this would involve creating space for multiple ways of knowing and responding to climate challenges while still enabling coordination where needed. Rather than imposing uniform approaches across diverse contexts, adaptation governance might embrace more flexible and modular frameworks that allow for context-specific approaches while maintaining sufficient common ground for collective action.

The regional patterns observed suggest that regional bodies could potentially play a more significant role in facilitating context-appropriate adaptation approaches. Currently, regional variations occur within a highly centralized global discourse, but regional institutions could potentially serve as spaces for developing more diverse approaches that better reflect regional priorities and knowledge systems. This would require strengthening the autonomy and capacity of regional bodies while creating mechanisms for meaningful knowledge exchange across regions [@ensor2009].

The consistently high discourse centralization across all dimensions suggests the need for more pluralistic approaches to adaptation knowledge production. As [@santos2014] argues, creating an "ecology of knowledges" requires recognizing the partial and situated nature of all knowledge systems and fostering productive dialogue between them. In adaptation governance, this might involve creating spaces where scientific, indigenous, local, and other knowledge systems can interact on equal terms, rather than privileging scientific and technical knowledge by default.

The high discourse centralization in low-income countries with minimal internal variation suggests the need to examine how adaptation finance mechanisms shape discourse patterns. Currently, accessing adaptation funding often requires countries to frame their needs in terms that align with donor priorities and expectations, potentially limiting the space for alternative approaches. Restructuring funding mechanisms to provide greater flexibility and autonomy to recipient countries might enable more diverse and context-appropriate adaptation approaches [@persson2014].

These implications highlight the need for adaptation governance that balances global coordination with epistemological diversity, technical expertise with local knowledge, and standardization with context-specificity. The empirical evidence of high discourse centralization across all dimensions suggests that current approaches tilt heavily toward uniformity, limiting the space for diverse knowledge systems and approaches. Creating more just and effective adaptation governance requires rebalancing these tensions to create space for multiple ways of knowing and being in relation to climate futures.

In conclusion, the empirical findings on discourse centralization in NAPs provide important insights into how adaptation is conceptualized across different contexts and what this reveals about power dynamics in climate governance. The high dominance indices across all dimensions, with income level emerging as the primary explanatory factor, suggest that adaptation discourse remains firmly embedded within existing development paradigms despite the distinct challenges that climate change presents. Addressing these challenges requires governance approaches that create space for diverse knowledge systems and futures while still enabling the coordination needed for effective global action. This remains one of the central challenges for adaptation governance in the context of North-South relations.
