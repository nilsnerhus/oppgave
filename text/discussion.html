<p>The main findings indicate that climate adaptation’s main organizing principles are fundamentally non-climate related. I argue that the vulnerability/adaptation relation should be understood as an updated form of the underdevelopment/development relation in North-South relations, paving the way for post-development critiques of adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The findings presented in the previous chapter reveal a striking centralization of adaptation discourse across National Adaptation Plans, with regional institutional networks emerging as the primary explanatory factor for what variation does exist. This brings us closer to understanding how climate adaptation actually functions in the real world, rather than as just a part of the UNFCCC negotiations. The patterns—high discourse homogeneity regardless of climate vulnerabilities, regional clustering that transcends physical geography, and the dominance of financial and procedural concerns—demand theoretical explanation. How can planning documents ostensibly designed to address diverse local climate impacts show such remarkable sameness? Why do countries facing fundamentally different climate futures articulate nearly identical responses? What does it mean that institutional proximity matters more than environmental exposure in shaping adaptation discourse?</p>
<p>This discussion argues that these patterns reveal climate adaptation functioning not as a technical response to environmental change but as a contemporary mechanism of colonial knowledge and power. Through systematic analysis of how adaptation discourse operates, I demonstrate that the vulnerability/adaptation nexus represents an updated version of the underdevelopment/development nexus that has structured North-South relations for decades. Just as development discourse constructed the Third World as lacking and requiring intervention, adaptation discourse constructs the Global South as vulnerable and requiring assistance—maintaining colonial relations through new vocabularies and institutional arrangements.</p>
<p>The analysis proceeds through four interconnected arguments, each building on the empirical patterns identified through structural topic modeling. First, I examine how the remarkable sameness across NAPs constitutes what has been termed epistemicide—the systematic elimination of alternative ways of knowing and responding to environmental change <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>. The dominance of financial mechanisms and technical procedures across all contexts reveals not diverse adaptation strategies but the violent imposition of a singular framework that renders other knowledge systems unspeakable. Second, I demonstrate how patterns of discourse convergence, particularly among low-income countries, reveal the active construction of climate vulnerability as a contemporary form of underdevelopment <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>. Countries must perform their vulnerability in specific ways to access resources, reinforcing dependencies rather than enabling autonomous responses to environmental change.</p>
<p>Third, I analyze how adaptation planning operates as an anti-politics machine, systematically transforming political questions about justice, responsibility, and structural transformation into technical problems of assessment and implementation <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>)</span>. The state-centric nature of adaptation planning combines with its technical character to evacuate political content, making it impossible to address the root causes of vulnerability within the adaptation framework. Finally, I explore what possibilities might exist beyond state-led adaptation, drawing on concepts of autonomy and pluriversal politics to imagine how communities might design their own transitions based on their own knowledge systems and values <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>. The variance patterns in the data, particularly among middle-income countries, suggest that even partial autonomy from international climate finance enables more diverse and potentially more appropriate approaches.</p>
<p>Throughout this discussion, I work to connect the quantitative patterns revealed by topic modeling to their theoretical and political implications. The high dominance indices, the regional clustering, the absence of geographic differentiation—these are not merely statistical findings but windows into how power operates through climate governance. By rendering this Northern discourse legible through computational analysis, we can see how adaptation planning functions to maintain rather than transform the colonial relations that produce vulnerability in the first place. This is not a story of failed implementation or insufficient resources but of a system working precisely as designed—to manage Southern territories and populations according to Northern frameworks while foreclosing alternative futures.</p>
<p>The stakes of this analysis extend beyond academic critique. If adaptation planning operates as epistemicide, if it constructs rather than responds to vulnerability, if it depoliticizes fundamental questions of justice—then current approaches to climate governance are not merely inadequate but actively harmful. They eliminate the knowledge systems and political possibilities that might enable genuine transformation while maintaining the fiction that technical adjustments can address what are fundamentally political problems. Understanding these dynamics is essential for those seeking to support communities facing climate impacts without reproducing colonial relations. The following sections develop each of these arguments in detail, working from the empirical findings toward their theoretical and practical implications.</p>
<section id="the-geography-of-sameness-mapping-epistemicide" class="level2" data-number="8.1">
<h2 data-number="8.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-geography-of-sameness-mapping-epistemicide"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> The Geography of Sameness: Mapping Epistemicide</h2>
<p>The most striking finding from the structural topic modeling is not the diversity of adaptation approaches but their fundamental sameness. Across 45 countries spanning radically different geographies, economies, and climate vulnerabilities, National Adaptation Plans converge on a remarkably narrow set of concerns: financial mechanisms, institutional procedures, monitoring frameworks, and technical assessments. This homogeneity becomes even more pronounced when examining regional clusters, where discourse centralization reaches levels that suggest not mere similarity but active reproduction of identical framings. What we observe is not adaptation to climate change but adaptation to the requirements of international climate finance—a profound narrowing of imaginative possibilities that demands theoretical explanation.</p>
<p>This pattern can be understood through the concept of epistemicide—the destruction of knowledge systems that do not conform to dominant Western scientific and bureaucratic paradigms <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-santos2016" role="doc-biblioref">Santos 2016</a>)</span>. In the context of climate adaptation, epistemicide operates not through direct suppression but through the more subtle violence of exclusion and non-recognition. The NAP process, with its standardized guidelines, technical requirements, and evaluation criteria, creates a discursive space where only certain forms of knowledge can be articulated. Traditional ecological knowledge, community-based practices, indigenous cosmologies, and local innovations—all of which have enabled human communities to navigate environmental variability for millennia—find no legitimate expression in documents dominated by vulnerability indices, cost-benefit analyses, and results-based management frameworks. This represents what critical scholars identify as the continuation of colonial violence through seemingly neutral technical processes <span class="citation" data-cites="dunlap2018 escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dunlap2018" role="doc-biblioref">Dunlap 2018</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The topic modeling results make this epistemicide quantitatively visible. When financial mechanisms and project management dominate the discourse across all countries, we witness the triumph of a particular way of knowing—one that frames climate adaptation as fundamentally a problem of resource allocation and technical implementation rather than social transformation or ecological relationship. The marginal presence of topics related to traditional knowledge or community practices (appearing in less than 3% of the corpus) reveals not what countries choose to exclude but what the NAP framework renders literally unspeakable. This echoes broader patterns in how Western knowledge systems establish themselves as universal while denying the validity of other ways of knowing <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2020 mignolo2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2020" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2020</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-mignolo2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mignolo 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The regional clustering patterns add another dimension to this analysis. That countries within regions show higher discourse similarity than countries facing similar climate impacts reveals how epistemicide operates through institutional networks. Regional development banks, technical assistance programs, and expert consultancies create networks of what development anthropologists term “development brokers”—intermediaries who translate global frameworks into local contexts while fundamentally maintaining the underlying epistemological assumptions <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis2006 mosse2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-lewis2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis and Mosse 2006</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-mosse2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mosse 2011</a>)</span>. These brokers do not simply facilitate knowledge transfer; they actively shape what counts as legitimate knowledge about adaptation. The same consultants working across multiple countries within a region create the patterns of convergence observed in our analysis, functioning as what critical scholars identify as carriers of “expert” knowledge that marginalizes local understandings <span class="citation" data-cites="bierschenk2002 brinks2025">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-bierschenk2002" role="doc-biblioref">Bierschenk, Chauveau, and de Sardan 2002</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-brinks2025" role="doc-biblioref">Brinks and Donner 2025</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The role of consultants in this process deserves deeper theoretical attention through the lens of what has been termed “tools for conviviality” <span class="citation" data-cites="illich2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-illich2009" role="doc-biblioref">Illich 2009</a>)</span>. In this framework, tools shape their users as much as users shape tools—creating dependencies and constraining possibilities even as they appear to enhance capabilities. The consultant is simultaneously a tool (employed by development institutions), a user of tools (frameworks, templates, assessment methodologies), and a producer of tools (standardized NAPs). This creates a recursive loop where the tools of adaptation planning—vulnerability indices, logical frameworks, results matrices—shape how consultants think, which shapes how countries must present their realities, which in turn reinforces the legitimacy of these same tools. The consultant arrives with a toolkit developed in Washington or Geneva, applies these tools across diverse contexts, and produces documents that confirm the validity of the original framework. Countries learn to see themselves through these tools, to articulate their needs in the language these tools recognize, and ultimately to reshape their own understanding of climate vulnerability to match what the tools can measure <span class="citation" data-cites="illich2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-illich2009" role="doc-biblioref">Illich 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The dominance of multilateral development banks in shaping adaptation discourse deserves particular attention. These institutions occupy a peculiar position—closer to Northern think tanks than Southern realities, yet positioned as intermediaries serving Southern needs. Their technical assistance programs, funding criteria, and knowledge products create powerful incentives for countries to frame adaptation in particular ways. This reflects what critics have long identified as the “will to improve” that characterizes development interventions—a desire to intervene that shapes both problems and solutions in ways that justify continued engagement <span class="citation" data-cites="li2007">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-li2007" role="doc-biblioref">Li 2007</a>)</span>. The convergence we observe is not accidental but structured by these institutional relationships, echoing patterns identified in earlier critiques of how development creates dependencies rather than autonomy <span class="citation" data-cites="illich2009 escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-illich2009" role="doc-biblioref">Illich 2009</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This process of epistemicide through adaptation planning is particularly insidious because it operates under the banner of helping vulnerable countries. Unlike earlier forms of colonial knowledge imposition, which at least could be recognized and resisted as foreign, the NAP process invites countries to participate in their own epistemological subordination. Countries must demonstrate they lack capacity (to secure technical assistance), adopt external frameworks (to access funding), and report in standardized formats (to maintain eligibility). This represents what scholars identify as a form of violence that operates through inclusion rather than exclusion—incorporating diverse contexts into a singular framework that eliminates their distinctiveness <span class="citation" data-cites="dunlap2018 whyte2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dunlap2018" role="doc-biblioref">Dunlap 2018</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2018" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>What makes this epistemicide through adaptation particularly effective is its technical character. By framing adaptation as a matter of proper assessment, planning, and implementation, the NAP process removes it from the realm of political contestation. This transformation—from the political to the technical—represents the operation of what critical development scholars have long identified as central to maintaining unequal power relations while appearing to address them <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994 escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="vulnerability-is-the-new-underdevelopment" class="level2" data-number="8.2">
<h2 data-number="8.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vulnerability-is-the-new-underdevelopment"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Vulnerability is the New Underdevelopment</h2>
<p>The patterns of discourse convergence among low-income countries reveal a disturbing parallel to earlier development paradigms. Where development discourse constructed the “Third World” as lacking—lacking capital, lacking technology, lacking institutions—adaptation discourse constructs these same countries as vulnerable—vulnerable to floods, vulnerable to droughts, vulnerable to climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>. This shift from “underdeveloped” to “vulnerable” maintains the same structural relationship: countries in need of external intervention, incapable of managing their own futures, requiring the technical expertise and financial resources of the developed world. The vulnerability/adaptation nexus thus emerges as the contemporary incarnation of the development/underdevelopment relationship that has structured North-South relations for decades.</p>
<p>The topic modeling results provide empirical evidence for this constructed vulnerability. Low-income countries show the second-highest level of discourse centralization (0.980), converging overwhelmingly on topics related to finance, capacity building, and institutional frameworks. This convergence does not reflect shared climate vulnerabilities—the low-income category includes both small island states facing sea-level rise and landlocked countries confronting desertification. Instead, it reflects their shared position in the global political economy as recipients of climate finance. Their NAPs read less as sovereign responses to environmental change and more as grant applications to international donors, carefully crafted to demonstrate both need and competence in terms legible to funding institutions.</p>
<p>This construction of vulnerability operates through what has been termed “anticipatory ruination”—the rendering of certain places as already lost, thereby justifying radical interventions that might otherwise face resistance <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2018" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2018</a>)</span>. In Bangladesh, this anticipatory ruination has justified the transformation of agricultural lands into shrimp farms, the displacement of rural communities, and the promotion of labor migration—all in the name of adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="paprocki2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2019" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2019</a>)</span>. The NAPs in our corpus show similar patterns: countries are encouraged to imagine themselves as future victims of climate change, to inventory their vulnerabilities, and to propose interventions that align with existing development paradigms. This process of imagining dystopian futures creates what scholars identify as a “climate of fear” that enables particular forms of intervention while foreclosing alternatives <span class="citation" data-cites="hulme2008">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hulme2008" role="doc-biblioref">Hulme 2008</a>)</span>. The future is foreclosed before it arrives, with adaptation pathways predetermined by institutional templates rather than community aspirations.</p>
<p>The use of climate change as what researchers term a “spice” for conventional development projects reveals how vulnerability construction serves multiple purposes <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2022" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2022</a>)</span>. In coastal Bangladesh, the same infrastructure projects that failed under development rationales—embankments, polders, flood controls—are repackaged as climate adaptation despite evidence they exacerbate the problems they claim to solve <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2021" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2021</a>)</span>. The NAPs show similar patterns of recycling, where conventional sectoral interventions in agriculture, water, and infrastructure are reframed as adaptation measures. Climate vulnerability thus becomes a new justification for old interventions, a pattern that extends beyond specific countries to encompass entire regions constructed as sacrifice zones for continued extraction <span class="citation" data-cites="tornel2024">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-tornel2024" role="doc-biblioref">Tornel 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The financial and procedural focus that dominates low-income country NAPs reveals how vulnerability construction serves institutional needs. These countries must perform their vulnerability in specific ways—through vulnerability assessments, risk matrices, and adaptation prioritizations—to access climate finance. Yet this performance requires a particular kind of capacity: the ability to produce documents legible to international institutions, to navigate complex funding mechanisms, and to report in standardized formats. Countries must simultaneously demonstrate vulnerability (to justify funding) and capacity (to manage funding), a contradictory position that reinforces their subordinate status in the climate finance architecture. This paradox reflects broader patterns in how environmental interventions create new forms of capture and control <span class="citation" data-cites="cons2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-cons2021" role="doc-biblioref">Cons 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The middle-income countries in our analysis present an intriguing counterpoint. They show the lowest levels of discourse centralization (lower-middle at 0.941, upper-middle at 0.958), suggesting greater autonomy in framing adaptation. This variance might reflect their intermediate position—less dependent on climate finance than low-income countries, yet not fully integrated into Northern knowledge networks like high-income countries. Their NAPs show more diverse topics, including attention to local contexts and specific sectoral concerns that escape the homogenizing pressure of donor requirements. This pattern suggests that partial autonomy from the climate finance system enables more diverse and potentially more appropriate adaptation framings, echoing findings about how frontier spaces sometimes escape full capture by dominant systems <span class="citation" data-cites="eilenberg2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eilenberg2015" role="doc-biblioref">Eilenberg 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The construction of vulnerability through adaptation discourse has material consequences beyond the discursive realm. When vulnerability is framed primarily in terms of institutional capacity and financial resources, the solutions inevitably focus on capacity building and resource transfer rather than addressing structural causes of vulnerability. The NAPs show little attention to questions of land rights, resource extraction, unfair trade relationships, or other political-economic factors that shape vulnerability. This reflects what critics identify as “climate reductionism”—the tendency to attribute all social and environmental problems to climate change while ignoring their deeper structural causes <span class="citation" data-cites="hulme2011 hulme2023">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hulme2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hulme 2011</a>, <a href="conclusion.html#ref-hulme2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>. Vulnerability appears as a technical condition requiring technical solutions—seawalls for coastal areas, drought-resistant seeds for agricultural regions, early warning systems for disaster-prone zones. These interventions may provide temporary relief but do not challenge the systems that produce vulnerability in the first place.</p>
<p>This technical framing of vulnerability serves multiple functions in the contemporary world order. For donor countries, it justifies continued intervention in the South while avoiding questions about their own contribution to climate change or structural inequality. For recipient country governments, it provides access to resources and legitimacy as responsible managers of adaptation. For the constellation of consultants, development organizations, and financial institutions that mediate these relationships, it ensures continued relevance and funding. Only for the communities whose vulnerability is ostensibly being addressed does this framing offer little—their knowledge remains marginalized, their agency constrained, and their futures determined by distant institutions. This represents what scholars identify as development-induced displacement masquerading as climate adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="dewan2021 paprocki2019">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dewan2021" role="doc-biblioref">Dewan 2021</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-paprocki2019" role="doc-biblioref">Paprocki 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The parallel between vulnerability construction in adaptation and underdevelopment in earlier paradigms extends to the solutions proposed. Just as development promised modernization through capital investment and technical assistance, adaptation promises resilience through climate finance and capacity building. Both paradigms assume that Southern countries lack something fundamental that Northern countries can provide. Both create dependencies rather than autonomy. Both transform diverse local realities into standardized problems amenable to standardized solutions. The persistence of these patterns across different issue areas and historical periods suggests deep structural continuities in North-South relations that surface-level policy changes cannot address. The shift from development to adaptation represents not a break with colonial relations but their continuation through new vocabularies and institutional arrangements <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar1995 escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>, <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. ## The Anti-Politics Machine in Climate Governance</p>
<p>The technical character of adaptation discourse exemplifies the operation of what has been termed the “anti-politics machine”—the process by which fundamentally political questions are transformed into technical problems requiring bureaucratic solutions <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>)</span>. Climate change adaptation involves profound political choices: whose knowledge counts, which communities receive protection, what futures are possible, how resources are distributed, and who bears responsibility for climate impacts. Yet the NAPs in our corpus systematically evacuate these political dimensions, replacing them with technical assessments, institutional procedures, and managerial frameworks. This depoliticization is not accidental but serves specific functions in maintaining existing power relations while appearing to address climate vulnerability.</p>
<p>The dominance of procedural and technical topics across all NAPs—monitoring frameworks, institutional arrangements, assessment methodologies—reveals how adaptation governance operates to render political questions technical. When countries must express their adaptation needs through logical frameworks, results-based management systems, and standardized indicators, the space for political contestation shrinks dramatically. Questions about why certain communities are vulnerable, how colonial histories shape present exposures, or whether proposed adaptations might exacerbate inequalities cannot be articulated within these technical formats. This reflects what scholars identify as the systematic depoliticization of environmental governance, where technical solutions obscure the power relations that produce environmental problems <span class="citation" data-cites="li2007 nightingale2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-li2007" role="doc-biblioref">Li 2007</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-nightingale2020" role="doc-biblioref">Nightingale et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The state-centric nature of the NAP process intensifies this depoliticization. By positioning national governments as the primary agents of adaptation planning, the UNFCCC framework privileges certain actors and scales while marginalizing others. States become the interlocutors for international finance, the arbiters of adaptation priorities, and the implementing agencies for interventions. This state-centricity serves multiple depoliticizing functions: it legitimizes existing governance structures, channels resources through established bureaucracies, and frames adaptation as a matter of proper administration rather than political transformation. Yet states themselves are often implicated in producing the vulnerabilities that adaptation claims to address—through forced displacement, resource extraction, or development policies that prioritize economic growth over community well-being <span class="citation" data-cites="eilenberg2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eilenberg2022" role="doc-biblioref">Eilenberg 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The empirical finding that geographic vulnerability explains almost no variance in adaptation discourse (only 1.8%) while regional institutional factors dominate reveals the depth of this depoliticization. If adaptation planning truly responded to climate impacts, we would expect countries facing similar physical challenges to develop similar approaches. Instead, the dominance of regional patterns suggests that institutional templates and bureaucratic networks shape adaptation discourse far more than actual climate vulnerabilities. This represents what critical scholars identify as “seeing like a state”—the reduction of complex socio-ecological realities to simplified categories amenable to bureaucratic intervention <span class="citation" data-cites="scott1998">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scott1998" role="doc-biblioref">Scott 1998</a>)</span>. The NAPs make countries legible to international climate finance institutions but in doing so obscure the messy realities of how communities actually experience and respond to environmental change.</p>
<p>The transformation of climate vulnerability into technical problems creates what scholars term “rendering technical”—a process that defines problems and solutions in ways that align with available tools and institutional capacities <span class="citation" data-cites="li2007">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-li2007" role="doc-biblioref">Li 2007</a>)</span>. Our topic modeling reveals this process quantitatively: the prevalence of topics related to data collection, modeling, assessment tools, and monitoring systems shows how adaptation planning privileges what can be measured, modeled, and managed. Complex questions about justice, responsibility, and alternative futures are reduced to indicators, targets, and deliverables. This technical rendering serves institutional needs—donors require measurable results, implementing agencies need clear procedures, and governments want demonstrable achievements—but may have little relevance to how communities experience climate impacts or envision adaptation.</p>
<p>The focus on vulnerability assessments and risk modeling exemplifies this anti-political operation. These tools appear as neutral, scientific approaches to understanding climate impacts, yet they embed particular assumptions about what constitutes vulnerability, whose knowledge counts in assessing it, and what kinds of interventions are appropriate. Vulnerability indices typically privilege quantifiable physical exposures and economic assets while marginalizing social relationships, cultural values, and political factors that shape how communities experience and respond to change. This represents what critics identify as the “scientization” of inherently political questions, where model outputs and expert assessments substitute for democratic deliberation about values, priorities, and futures <span class="citation" data-cites="hulme2011 nightingale2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hulme2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hulme 2011</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-nightingale2020" role="doc-biblioref">Nightingale et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The procedural focus that dominates adaptation discourse—with extensive attention to institutional arrangements, coordination mechanisms, and governance frameworks—further depoliticizes adaptation by suggesting that better administration can solve what are fundamentally political problems. If communities are vulnerable because of land dispossession, the solution is not better coordination between ministries. If fishing villages face increased storm exposure because of mangrove destruction for shrimp farms, the answer is not improved early warning systems. Yet the NAPs consistently frame adaptation challenges as matters of institutional capacity, inter-agency coordination, and information management. This reflects broader patterns in how international development depoliticizes poverty and inequality by focusing on technical and institutional solutions <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson1994 escobar1995">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ferguson1994" role="doc-biblioref">Ferguson 1994</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar1995" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The absence of certain topics in the NAPs is as revealing as what appears. Our analysis shows minimal attention to issues of land rights, resource extraction, trade relationships, debt, or other structural factors that shape vulnerability. Historical responsibility for climate change appears nowhere in the dominant topics. Questions of reparations, compensation, or fundamental economic restructuring—all central to climate justice movements—find no expression in these technical documents. This absence is not oversight but structured silencing, where the format and requirements of adaptation planning systematically exclude political critique. As scholars note, such systematic exclusions reveal how states and international institutions actively “unknow” politically inconvenient realities <span class="citation" data-cites="figueroa-helland2014 whyte2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-figueroa-helland2014" role="doc-biblioref">Figueroa-Helland and Borg 2014</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2020" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The anti-politics machine of adaptation serves multiple constituencies even as it fails those most vulnerable to climate impacts. For donor countries, it transforms moral and political obligations into voluntary technical assistance, avoiding questions about historical emissions or ongoing extraction. For international institutions, it creates a manageable problem space amenable to existing tools and procedures. For national governments, it provides resources and legitimacy while avoiding challenges to existing power structures. For the adaptation industry—consultants, NGOs, research institutions—it ensures continued relevance and funding. This alignment of interests helps explain the persistence of depoliticized adaptation despite mounting evidence of its inadequacy <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021 scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al. 2021</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The operation of adaptation as an anti-politics machine connects directly to our earlier analysis of epistemicide and vulnerability construction. By rendering political questions technical, adaptation planning eliminates space for alternative knowledge systems that might frame problems differently. By constructing vulnerability as a technical condition requiring technical solutions, it forecloses political mobilization around structural causes. The three processes work together to maintain existing power relations while appearing to address climate impacts. This brings us to the crucial question: if state-led adaptation planning operates as an anti-politics machine that forecloses alternative futures, what possibilities exist beyond this framework?</p>

<p>If adaptation planning operates as a mechanism of epistemicide, vulnerability construction, and depoliticization, what alternatives might exist? The variance patterns in our data—particularly the greater discourse diversity among middle-income countries—suggest that partial autonomy from international climate finance enables more diverse approaches. This empirical finding aligns with theoretical work on pluriversal politics that imagines worlds beyond the singular world of modernity, development, and now adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018 escobar2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>, <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Rather than seeking better adaptation within existing frameworks, these approaches ask: what if communities designed their own transitions based on their own ontologies, epistemologies, and aspirations?</p>
<p>The concept of autonomy provides a crucial entry point for reimagining adaptation beyond the state <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>)</span>. Autonomy here does not mean isolation or pure self-sufficiency but rather the capacity of communities to determine their own paths based on their own knowledge systems and values. The Zapatista concept of “mandar obedeciendo” (governing by obeying) exemplifies this approach—leadership that responds to community needs rather than imposing external frameworks <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2020" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2020</a>)</span>. In the context of climate adaptation, autonomy would mean communities identifying their own vulnerabilities (which might not align with technical assessments), developing their own responses (which might not fit donor categories), and evaluating success by their own criteria (which might not translate into indicators).</p>
<p>The middle-income variance in our data offers tantalizing glimpses of what partial autonomy enables. These countries, less dependent on climate finance and technical assistance, show greater diversity in their adaptation framings. They incorporate more place-specific concerns, sectoral particularities, and diverse knowledge sources. While still operating within the NAP framework, they demonstrate that even limited autonomy from financial dependencies creates space for more contextually appropriate approaches. This suggests that the homogenization we observe among low-income countries is not inevitable but produced by specific institutional arrangements that could be otherwise <span class="citation" data-cites="demaria2023 escobar2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-demaria2023" role="doc-biblioref">Demaria et al. 2023</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Indigenous movements across the globe offer concrete examples of adaptation beyond state frameworks that our methodology cannot capture but that point toward possibilities <span class="citation" data-cites="corntassel2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-corntassel2021" role="doc-biblioref">Corntassel 2021</a>)</span>. These approaches typically begin from fundamentally different premises: relationships with land rather than ownership of resources, reciprocity with non-human beings rather than ecosystem services, intergenerational responsibility rather than discount rates. When indigenous communities in the Americas speak of climate change, they often frame it as symptomatic of deeper relational failures that require healing relationships rather than technical fixes <span class="citation" data-cites="whyte2018 whyte2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2018" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte 2018</a>, <a href="conclusion.html#ref-whyte2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Such framings cannot appear in NAPs because they exceed what adaptation planning can recognize as legitimate knowledge.</p>
<p>The call for decolonization in climate governance goes beyond incorporating indigenous knowledge into existing frameworks—a move that often serves to further marginalize and extract from indigenous communities <span class="citation" data-cites="tuck2012">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-tuck2012" role="doc-biblioref">Tuck and Yang 2012</a>)</span>. Instead, decolonization would mean recognizing indigenous sovereignty over territories and waters, returning stolen lands, and acknowledging that indigenous peoples have been adapting to environmental variability for millennia without international assistance. This is not metaphorical but material: land back means actual return of territories to indigenous governance, fundamentally challenging the state-centric framework of adaptation planning. Such approaches recognize that for many communities, the state itself is a source of vulnerability rather than adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="deranger2022">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-deranger2022" role="doc-biblioref">Deranger et al. 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The pluriverse—a world where many worlds fit—offers a framework for thinking beyond the singular world of adaptation planning <span class="citation" data-cites="escobar2018 reiter2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-escobar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Escobar 2018</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-reiter2018" role="doc-biblioref">Reiter 2018</a>)</span>. This is not relativism but recognition that different peoples inhabit genuinely different worlds with different relationships to what the West calls “nature” and “climate.” The Andean concept of “buen vivir,” the African philosophy of “ubuntu,” and countless other non-Western ontologies offer different starting points for understanding human-environment relationships that might generate entirely different approaches to environmental change <span class="citation" data-cites="demaria2023">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-demaria2023" role="doc-biblioref">Demaria et al. 2023</a>)</span>. These are not alternative “adaptations” but alternative worlds where the adaptation/vulnerability framing might not even make sense.</p>
<p>The concept of “provincializing Europe” helps understand what moving beyond state adaptation might entail <span class="citation" data-cites="chakrabarty2009">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-chakrabarty2009" role="doc-biblioref">Chakrabarty 2009</a>)</span>. Rather than accepting European-derived categories (including the state, development, and adaptation) as universal, this approach reveals them as particular, historical products that achieved global dominance through colonial violence. Provincializing adaptation would mean recognizing it as one possible response to environmental change emerging from specific historical and institutional contexts, not a universal framework that all must adopt. This opens space for other histories, knowledge systems, and futures that have been suppressed by the universalizing tendencies of Western modernity <span class="citation" data-cites="mignolo2011 quijano2000">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mignolo2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mignolo 2011</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-quijano2000" role="doc-biblioref">Quijano and Ennis 2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The practical implications of moving beyond state adaptation are profound and challenging. It would mean redirecting climate finance from state bureaucracies to autonomous community organizations. It would mean recognizing knowledge systems that international institutions cannot easily quantify or control. It would mean accepting outcomes that do not fit into logical frameworks or results matrices. Most fundamentally, it would mean Northern countries addressing their own emissions and consumption rather than reshaping Southern societies through adaptation planning. As critics note, perhaps the most effective adaptation support would be rapid industrial decarbonization in the North, eliminating the problem at its source rather than managing its symptoms in the South <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-eriksen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eriksen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The barriers to such transformation are substantial. States jealously guard their sovereignty and their role as intermediaries for international resources. International institutions have invested heavily in frameworks, procedures, and expertise oriented toward state-led planning. The adaptation industry depends on continued funding for assessments, capacity building, and project implementation. Moving beyond state adaptation would threaten all these interests. Yet our analysis reveals that current approaches produce homogenization, depoliticization, and epistemicide—outcomes that serve institutional needs while failing those most vulnerable to climate impacts.</p>
<p>The high discourse centralization documented in this research should not lead to despair but to clarity about the nature of the challenge. The adaptation regime, like the development regime before it, is not a natural or inevitable response to environmental change but a historically specific configuration of power that can be contested and transformed. The cracks in the system—the variance among middle-income countries, the persistence of community-based practices despite their marginalization, the growing critique from scholars and activists—suggest that other worlds remain possible. Whether these possibilities can flourish depends not on better planning or more finance but on fundamental shifts in power relations between North and South, states and communities, experts and inhabitants.</p>
<p>This analysis returns us to fundamental questions about climate justice that transcend the technical framings of adaptation planning. If adaptation operates as a contemporary form of colonialism—imposing Northern frameworks, eliminating alternative knowledges, and foreclosing autonomous futures—then climate justice requires more than reformed institutions or increased finance. It requires recognizing and supporting the multiple worlds that exist beyond the singular world of development and adaptation. The implications of this recognition form the basis for our concluding reflections on the future of climate governance and the possibilities for genuine transformation in North-South relations.</p>
