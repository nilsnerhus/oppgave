# Literature review {#sec-lit}

> The literature on climate adaptation is divided between the adaptation nexus approach that emphasizes technical solutions and capacity building within existing systems and the adaptation regime critique that views adaptation discourse as a technique of power reinforcing rather than challenging global inequalities.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, this section presents the two main strands of climate adaptation research. One is sympathetic, the adaptation nexus, while the other is critical, the adaptation regime. Climate adaptation is concerned with vulnerability to climate damages, and the main disagreement centers on how vulnerability is produced and what constitutes appropriate response.

The literature in this field maps onto broader debates in development studies, where the study of interventions in other societies has a long theoretical history. These competing paradigms reveal fundamentally different understandings of what adaptation is, how vulnerability is produced, and consequently, what appropriate interventions look like.

## Adaptation Nexus

> The adaptation nexus approach operates on a fundamental logic of provision: Southern countries lack something essential (capacity, technology, institutions, knowledge) that Northern countries can provide, creating seemingly reasonable frameworks where convergence around best practices reflects learning rather than control.

The adaptation nexus fundamentally rests on what might be termed a "deficit model" of Southern societies. Within this framework, climate vulnerability emerges primarily from the absence of particular capacities, technologies, or institutional arrangements that enable effective response to environmental challenges. This logic creates a seemingly natural division of labor: Northern countries and international institutions possess the technical expertise, financial resources, and institutional knowledge needed to address climate challenges, while Southern countries require assistance to build the capacity necessary for effective adaptation [@ireland2010].

This approach has deep roots in mainstream development thinking, particularly the evolution from traditional top-down approaches toward more participatory and locally-responsive interventions. The participatory turn in development, initially championed by scholars like Paulo Freire and Robert Chambers, emphasized the importance of incorporating local knowledge and ensuring community involvement in development processes [@freire1970; @chambers1994]. However, as these participatory techniques became institutionalized within major development organizations, they underwent significant transformation. What began as radical challenges to expert-driven development became tools for more effective implementation of essentially unchanged development paradigms.

The chronological evolution reveals how different development streams converged into contemporary adaptation approaches. The participatory development movement of the 1990s ran parallel to the emergence of human security frameworks that expanded the concept of security beyond state-centered military concerns [@undp1994; @rothschild1995]. This expansion occurred along both ontological and epistemological lines, recognizing new objects of security (individuals, communities, environments) and new ways of understanding security threats [@buur2007]. When climate science began documenting large-scale future risks [@lenton2023], including the transgression of planetary boundaries [@steffen2015; @richardson2023], this existing apparatus of expanded security thinking naturally incorporated climate change as a security challenge requiring coordinated response [@waever1995].

The "local turn" in international interventions further shaped this evolution [@macginty2013; @macginty2015]. Recognition that top-down interventions often failed to achieve their objectives led to increased emphasis on local ownership, cultural sensitivity, and context-specific approaches. However, this local turn occurred within institutional frameworks that maintained fundamental assumptions about the need for external expertise and resources. The result was hybrid approaches that emphasized participation and local adaptation while preserving the basic structure of Northern institutions designing and funding interventions in Southern contexts.

Contemporary climate adaptation frameworks explicitly embrace participatory approaches and local adaptation. National Adaptation Plans typically include extensive sections on stakeholder participation and community engagement [@rmi2022]. International frameworks consistently emphasize the importance of incorporating local knowledge and ensuring that adaptation measures are "locally adapted" to specific contexts [@lavoine2024; @lawrence2024]. Organizations promote participatory approaches that supposedly enable communities to identify their own priorities and design appropriate responses [@ipes-food2018; @diaz2016].

The ecosystem services framework exemplifies how the nexus approach attempts to bridge global and local concerns [@almenar2021; @gret-regamey2012]. By quantifying the economic value of natural systems, this approach promises to make environmental protection economically rational while incorporating both local values [@bingen2000; @sen2000] and global concerns like biodiversity conservation and climate regulation [@woodhead2019; @brander2012; @pascual2023; @lawrence2022]. This framework enables the calculation of co-benefits, where single interventions can simultaneously address multiple challenges - climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, and economic growth.

The practical implementation of nexus approaches relies heavily on standardized tools and frameworks designed to manage complexity while ensuring accountability to donors and implementing agencies. The logical framework approach [@ortengren2004], with its apparently value-neutral methodology, breaks complex social and environmental challenges into discrete problems with measurable solutions. Traffic deaths become a workshop problem; climate vulnerability becomes a capacity building challenge. These tools promise to limit exposure to the unpredictable aspects of local contexts while ensuring that interventions can be planned, implemented, and evaluated according to recognizable criteria.

The role of non-governmental organizations in this system reflects the broader transformation of development practice [@banks2015]. NGOs that deliver services based on donor budgets often function as implementation agencies rather than independent advocates, creating dynamics where the distinction between NGOs and government agencies becomes minimal [@kansiime2019]. This convergence around service delivery models reinforces the technical orientation of adaptation interventions, where success is measured by the effective delivery of predetermined services rather than by more complex measures of social or environmental transformation.

States themselves are understood within this framework as having mixed track records in delivering development outcomes, creating natural justification for limiting exposure to unpredictable local political dynamics. Technical approaches promise to insulate interventions from the complexities of local governance while focusing on measurable outcomes that can be evaluated according to international standards. The emphasis on building institutional capacity aims to strengthen state systems while ensuring they operate according to internationally recognized best practices.

This nexus understanding sees vulnerability as an individual's or community's lack of certain skills, capabilities, or access to resources. When the right resources are provided, this is expected to trigger an upward spiral where outcomes improve across multiple dimensions [@schipper2020]. This conceptualization focuses on characteristics of individuals or communities that make them susceptible to harm - limited assets, poor infrastructure, weak institutions - and frames vulnerability primarily as a condition rather than a process.

The nexus approach maintains that standardization and convergence reflect genuine learning and the dissemination of best practices. Complex challenges like climate adaptation require sophisticated technical knowledge, and it makes sense that countries facing similar challenges would adopt similar solutions. International coordination prevents the wasteful duplication of effort while ensuring that limited resources are used effectively. Frameworks like those developed by the Climate Policy Initiative attempt to create taxonomies that prevent climate finance from becoming so broadly defined as to lose meaning [@buchner2023].

From this perspective, the convergence observed in adaptation planning represents successful knowledge transfer and institutional learning. The focus on procedural frameworks and institutional arrangements reflects the reality that effective adaptation requires coordination across sectors and scales. Countries naturally concentrate on these procedural elements because they are necessary foundations for more substantive adaptation measures. The dominance of financial and institutional topics in adaptation plans demonstrates responsible attention to the mechanisms needed to actually implement adaptation rather than merely describing aspirational goals.

## Adaptation Regime

> The adaptation regime critique draws from post-structural analysis to reveal how adaptation discourse functions as a technique of power that constructs vulnerability in ways that legitimize conventional development interventions while foreclosing alternative futures.

The adaptation regime critique fundamentally challenges the nexus assumption that the South lacks something the North can provide. Instead, this perspective argues that the South is systematically oppressed by Northern-dominated structures, and that the best way to help may be to provide no help at all, thereby enabling re-politicization of issues that development discourse has rendered technical [@escobar1995]. This argument captures what many development practitioners recognize as the absurdity of development work when experienced from within, though it becomes less convincing the further one moves from direct experience of these interventions.

This critique has roots in post-development thinking that emerged from anthropological and philosophical challenges to the entire development project [@demaria2023; @dunlap2025; @escobar1995]. Post-development scholars argue that development discourse fundamentally constructs its objects - poverty, underdevelopment, vulnerability - in ways that justify particular forms of intervention while making alternatives invisible. Rather than addressing pre-existing problems, development creates the very problems it claims to solve by imposing particular ways of understanding social reality.

The concept of governmentality, adapted from Michel Foucault's analysis of modern power, provides crucial insights into how adaptation interventions operate [@agrawal2005]. Governmentality refers to the management of possibilities - shaping the conditions within which people act rather than directly controlling their actions. In environmental contexts, this involves creating new kinds of environmental subjects who come to understand themselves and their relationships with nature in particular ways. Participation in environmental governance transforms how people relate to forests, water, or climate, making them into particular kinds of environmental citizens.

James Ferguson's analysis of the "anti-politics machine" demonstrates how development interventions systematically transform political questions into technical problems [@ferguson1994]. Even when development projects fail to achieve their stated objectives, they successfully expand bureaucratic state power and depoliticize issues like poverty by rendering them as technical challenges requiring expert solutions. This transformation eliminates space for political mobilization around the structural causes of poverty while legitimizing continued intervention by external experts.

The concept of "seeing like a state" reveals how institutions render complex social realities legible through simplified categories that enable bureaucratic intervention [@scott1998]. States and state-like institutions require standardized information that can be processed through administrative systems, leading to the elimination of local particularities that cannot be captured in standardized formats. This process makes societies legible to power while often making them more vulnerable to the interventions that such legibility enables.

Tania Murray Li's analysis of "the will to improve" shows how the desire to intervene shapes both problems and solutions in ways that justify continued engagement [@li2007]. Experts identify problems that match their capacity to intervene, creating recursive loops where interventions generate new problems that require further intervention. This will to improve operates through genuine desires to help while systematically reproducing the conditions that create the need for help.

The operation of what might be called the "stadium tour" of international development creates its own epistemological community that moves between contexts without fundamentally engaging with local realities [@craze2021; @autesserre2014; @mosse2011; @paprocki2018]. This system employs vast numbers of people - recent layoffs in international development organizations revealed the scale of this apparatus - who move between similar institutional settings while maintaining consistent approaches regardless of context. The same consultants apply the same frameworks across different countries, creating convergence that reflects institutional needs rather than contextual appropriateness.

Arun Agrawal's concept of "environmentality" extends this analysis to environmental governance, showing how participation in environmental management transforms subjects' relationships with nature [@agrawal2005]. People who participate in forest management or climate adaptation programs learn to see themselves and their environments in new ways, often internalizing the categories and priorities of the intervening institutions. This transformation operates not through coercion but through the seemingly positive process of capacity building and empowerment.

Climate reductionism represents a particular form of this environmentality, where complex social and political challenges are rendered as climate problems requiring climate solutions [@hulme2008; @hulme2011]. This reductionism makes it possible to avoid addressing structural inequalities while focusing on technical responses to climate impacts. All social issues become climate issues, justifying interventions that might otherwise face political resistance.

Kasia Paprocki's ethnographic work in Bangladesh demonstrates how adaptation discourse constructs certain places as inevitably vulnerable, enabling "anticipatory ruination" that justifies radical transformations in the present [@paprocki2018]. Communities are rendered as future climate victims, making it possible to implement interventions that displace current livelihoods in the name of climate adaptation. The construction of climate vulnerability becomes a mechanism for facilitating economic transformations that serve export markets rather than local communities.

Camelia Dewan's analysis reveals how climate change serves as "spice" that makes old development projects fundable under new climate rationales [@dewan2022]. Infrastructure projects that failed under development justifications are repackaged as climate adaptation despite evidence that they exacerbate the problems they claim to solve. The climate framing enables the continuation of harmful interventions while making political critique more difficult.

The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession [@paprocki2018]. Dystopian climate futures are imagined that justify present interventions. These imagined futures enable experimentation with new forms of social and economic organization in the name of climate adaptation. The result is often dispossession - the elimination of existing livelihoods and social arrangements in the name of building resilience to climate change.

This process of anticipatory ruination creates what scholars identify as a "climate of fear" that enables particular forms of intervention while foreclosing alternatives [@hulme2008]. The future is foreclosed before it arrives, with adaptation pathways predetermined by institutional templates rather than community aspirations. Complex political-economic realities are reduced to technical problems of climate vulnerability, making it impossible to address the structural causes of environmental degradation.
