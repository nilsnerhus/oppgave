# Literature review {#sec-lit}

This chapter presents the two main strands of climate adaptation research. One is sympathetic, the adaptation nexus, while the other is critical, the adaptation regime. Climate adaptation is concerned with vulnerability to climate damages, and the main disagreement centers on how vulnerability is produced and what constitutes appropriate response.

The literature in this field maps onto broader debates in development studies, where the study of interventions in other societies has a long theoretical history. These competing paradigms reveal fundamentally different understandings of what adaptation is, how vulnerability is produced, and consequently, what appropriate interventions look like.

## Adaptation Nexus

The adaptation nexus fundamentally rests on what could be understood as an idea of modernization. Within this framework, climate vulnerability emerges primarily from the absence of particular capacities, technologies, or institutional arrangements that enable effective response to environmental challenges. This logic creates a seemingly natural division of labor: Northern countries and international institutions possess the technical expertise, financial resources, and institutional knowledge needed to address climate challenges, while Southern countries require assistance to build the capacity necessary for effective adaptation [@ireland2010]. 

This approach has deep roots in mainstream development thinking, where the main idea was to make sure that countries modernized, rapidly and effectivly, through the imagined stages of growth, to finally become industrial economies [@escobar1995]. This was not to happen without considerable change and suffering, for the greater good. 

The goal of modernization was shared in both the neo-liberal and the neo-marxist approaches, with the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union also being part of this paradigme , although after the fall of the Soviet Union, the neo-liberal paradigme was the only one left, and the shock-therapy model of industrial development the central one [@gevorkyan2018]

After the largely failed attempts with shock therapy, the mainstream attention shifted to more bottom-up and participatory approaches that had been one the fringes before. The participatory turn in development, initially championed by scholars like Paulo Freire and Robert Chambers, emphasized the importance of incorporating local knowledge and ensuring community involvement in development processes [@freire1970; @chambers1994]. 

However, as these participatory techniques became institutionalized within major development organizations, they underwent significant transformation. What began as radical challenges to expert-driven development became tools for more effective implementation of essentially unchanged development paradigms [@banks2015].

The participatory development movement of the 1990s ran parallel to the emergence of human security frameworks that expanded the concept of security beyond state-centered military concerns [@undp1994; @rothschild1995]. This expansion occurred along both ontological and epistemological lines, recognizing new objects of security (individuals, communities, environments) and new ways of understanding security threats [@buur2007]. 

When climate science began documenting large-scale future risks [@lenton2023], including the transgression of planetary boundaries [@steffen2015; @richardson2023], this existing apparatus of expanded security thinking naturally incorporated climate change as a security challenge requiring coordinated response [@waever1995].

The "local turn" in international interventions further shaped this evolution [@macginty2013; @macginty2015]. Recognition that top-down interventions often failed to achieve their objectives led to increased emphasis on local ownership, cultural sensitivity, and context-specific approaches. However, this local turn occurred within institutional frameworks that maintained fundamental assumptions about the need for external expertise and resources. The result was hybrid approaches that emphasized participation and local adaptation while preserving the basic structure of Northern institutions designing and funding interventions in Southern contexts.

nternational frameworks consistently emphasize the importance of incorporating local knowledge and ensuring that adaptation measures are "locally adapted" to specific contexts [@lavoine2024; @lawrence2024]. Organizations promote participatory approaches that supposedly enable communities to identify their own priorities and design appropriate responses [@ipes-food2018; @diaz2016].

The ecosystem services framework exemplifies how the nexus approach attempts to bridge global and local concerns [@almenar2021; @gret-regamey2012]. By quantifying the economic value of natural systems, this approach promises to make environmental protection economically rational while incorporating both local values [@bingen2000; @sen2000] and global concerns like biodiversity conservation and climate regulation [@woodhead2019; @brander2012; @pascual2023; @lawrence2022]. 

The central thing is that this framework enables the calculation of co-benefits, where single interventions can simultaneously address multiple challenges - climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, and economic growth. And since these approaches go across scales, both large scale infrastrucure development, the shock therapy-model where one can trade some suffereing for the greater good and small-scale projects aimed to help a certain community, can co-exist in the same epistemoligical community [@defrancesco2020].

The practical implementation of nexus approaches relies heavily on standardized tools and frameworks designed to manage complexity while ensuring accountability to donors and implementing agencies. The logical framework approach , with its apparently value-neutral methodology inherent in its name, breaks complex social and environmental challenges into discrete problems with measurable solutions [@ortengren2004].

These tools promise to limit exposure to the unpredictable aspects of local contexts while ensuring that interventions can be planned, implemented, and evaluated according to recognizable criteria. While these tools often are well-suited to extract local knowledge, it puts the emphasie on the person doing the workshop, and the people analysing the data, making them easy to do wrong [@dewan2022].   

The role of non-governmental organizations in this system reflects the broader transformation of development practice [@banks2015]. NGOs that deliver services based on donor budgets often function as implementation agencies rather than independent advocates, creating dynamics where the distinction between NGOs and government agencies becomes minimal [@kansiime2019]. This convergence around service delivery models reinforces the technical orientation of adaptation interventions, where success is measured by the effective delivery of predetermined services rather than by more complex measures of social or environmental transformation.

States themselves are understood within this framework as having mixed track records in delivering development outcomes, creating natural justification for limiting exposure to unpredictable local political dynamics [@banks2015]. Technical approaches promise to insulate interventions from the complexities of local governance while focusing on measurable outcomes that can be evaluated according to international standards. The emphasis on building institutional capacity aims to strengthen state systems while ensuring they operate according to internationally recognized best practices.

This nexus understanding sees vulnerability as an individual's, community's or state's lack of certain skills, capabilities, or access to resources. When the right resources are provided, this is expected to trigger an upward spiral where outcomes improve across multiple dimensions [@schipper2020]. This conceptualization focuses on characteristics of individuals or communities that make them susceptible to harm - limited assets, poor infrastructure, weak institutions - and frames vulnerability primarily as a condition rather than a process.

The nexus approach maintains that standardization and convergence reflect genuine learning and the dissemination of best practices. Complex challenges like climate adaptation require sophisticated technical knowledge, and it makes sense that countries facing similar challenges would adopt similar solutions. International coordination prevents the wasteful duplication of effort while ensuring that limited resources are used effectively. Frameworks like those developed by the Climate Policy Initiative attempt to create taxonomies that prevent climate finance from becoming so broadly defined as to lose meaning [@buchner2023].

## Adaptation Regime

The adaptation regime critique fundamentally challenges the nexus assumption that the South lacks something the North can provide. Instead, this perspective argues that the South is systematically oppressed by Northern-dominated structures, and that the best way to help may be to provide no help at all, thereby enabling re-politicization of issues that development discourse has rendered technical [@escobar1995]. 

This critique has roots in post-development thinking that emerged from post-strucural challenges to the entire development project [@demaria2023; @dunlap2025; @escobar1995]. Post-development scholars argue that development discourse fundamentally constructs its objects, poverty, underdevelopment, vulnerability, in ways that justify particular forms of intervention while making alternatives invisible. Rather than addressing pre-existing problems, development creates the very problems it claims to solve by imposing particular ways of understanding social reality.

The concept of governmentality, adapted from Michel Foucault's analysis of modern power, provides crucial insights into how adaptation interventions operate [@agrawal2005;@li2007;@ferguson1994;@escobar1995]. Governmentality refers to the management of possibilities - shaping the conditions within which people act rather than directly controlling their actions. 

In environmental contexts, this involves creating new kinds of environmental subjects who come to understand themselves and their relationships with nature in particular ways. Participation in environmental governance transforms how people relate to forests, water, or climate, making them into particular kinds of environmental citizens [@agrawal2005]. Through his research with forest management cooperatives, Agrawal identified the ways the participation in the scheme transforment the community into self-policiing units, adpoting the governments idea of the right and wrong use of the forest [@agrawal2005]. The making of new subjects is important, because it highlights how the knowledge also travels into peoples own imaginations of themselves. 

Climate reductionism represents a particular form of this environmentality, where complex social and political challenges are rendered as climate problems requiring climate solutions [@hulme2008; @hulme2011]. This reductionism makes it possible to avoid addressing structural inequalities while focusing on technical responses to climate impacts. All social issues become climate issues, justifying interventions that might otherwise face political resistance.

James Ferguson's analysis of the "anti-politics machine" demonstrates how development interventions systematically transform political questions into technical problems [@ferguson1994]. His work was on the development apparatus in Lesotho. Here, he showed how the problem of development was imagined as overgrazing, because of a lack of a market to sell the livestock through. When the roads were built, and the markets were set up, the project did not solve the issue of overgrazing. 

Despite this apparent failure, Ferguson argued that the project had failed in the same predicable way all development projects do. Despite failing to achieve the stated objectives, the project successfully expand bureaucratic state power by enabling control through the establishment of road infrastructure and government instutions in the project area. 

The control, and the project itself, then depoliticize issues like poverty by rendering them as technical challenges requiring expert solutions, and enabling the state to be the solution. This transformation eliminates space for political mobilization around the structural causes of poverty while legitimizing continued intervention by external experts [@ferguson1994}.

The concept of "seeing like a state" reveals how institutions render complex social realities legible through simplified categories that enable bureaucratic intervention [@scott1998]. States and state-like institutions require standardized information that can be processed through administrative systems, leading to the elimination of local particularities that cannot be captured in standardized formats. This process makes societies legible to power while often making them more vulnerable to the interventions that such legibility enables.

Tania Murray Li's analysis of "the will to improve" shows how the desire to intervene shapes both problems and solutions in ways that justify continued engagement [@li2007]. Experts identify problems that match their capacity to intervene, creating recursive loops where interventions generate new problems that require further intervention. This will to improve operates through genuine desires to help while systematically reproducing the conditions that create the need for help, spanning across time to 

The operation of what might be called the "stadium tour" of international development creates its own epistemological community that moves between contexts without fundamentally engaging with local realities [@craze2021; @autesserre2014; @mosse2011; @paprocki2018].

Kasia Paprocki's ethnographic work in Bangladesh demonstrates how adaptation discourse constructs certain places as inevitably vulnerable, enabling "anticipatory ruination" that justifies radical transformations in the present [@paprocki2018]. Communities are rendered as future climate victims, making it possible to implement interventions that displace current livelihoods in the name of climate adaptation. The construction of climate vulnerability becomes a mechanism for facilitating economic transformations that serve export markets rather than local communities.

Camelia Dewan's analysis reveals how climate change serves as "spice" that makes old development projects fundable under new climate rationales [@dewan2022]. Infrastructure projects, the building of flood protection polders, that failed under development justifications are repackaged as climate adaptation despite evidence that they exacerbate the problems they claim to solve. The climate framing enables the continuation of harmful interventions while making political critique more difficult.

The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession [@paprocki2018]. Dystopian climate futures are imagined that justify present interventions. These imagined futures enable experimentation with new forms of social and economic organization in the name of climate adaptation. The result is often dispossession - the elimination of existing livelihoods and social arrangements in the name of building resilience to climate change.

This process of anticipatory ruination creates what scholars identify as a "climate of fear" that enables particular forms of intervention while foreclosing alternatives [@hulme2008]. The future is foreclosed before it arrives, with adaptation pathways predetermined by institutional templates rather than community aspirations. Complex political-economic realities are reduced to technical problems of climate vulnerability, making it impossible to address the structural causes of environmental degradation.
