<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Climate adaptation is becoming a central part of development governance, where the goal is to finesse the three pillars to get the optimal political economy outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>International climate change action is governed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Summit also created two other conventions, The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. Together, these frameworks established new institutional arrangements for addressing global environmental challenges.</p>
<p>Central to the UNFCCC is the principle of “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities” (CBDR), which acknowledges that while climate change affects all nations, industrialized countries bear greater historical responsibility for emissions and consequently should lead in providing solutions and support <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. This principle has become a cornerstone of international climate negotiations, though its interpretation has evolved over time, particularly as the economic circumstances of various countries have changed.</p>
<p>The CBDR principle fundamentally shaped North-South dynamics in climate governance by establishing differential obligations between developed countries (listed in Annex I and II of the convention) and developing countries. This differentiation created a framework where industrialized nations were expected to take the lead in emissions reductions while also providing financial and technological support to developing countries <span class="citation" data-cites="persson2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-persson2014" role="doc-biblioref">Persson and Remling 2014</a>)</span>. These power relations have remained central to climate negotiations, even as the governance architecture has evolved to include adaptation and loss and damage alongside mitigation.</p>
<p>Climate governance has evolved through three distinct pillars: mitigation (established at Kyoto in 1997), adaptation (formalized at Cancun in 2010), and loss and damage (incorporated in the Paris Agreement in 2015). This evolution reflects growing recognition of climate impacts and the inadequacy of mitigation alone, while also revealing shifting North-South dynamics in how climate challenges are conceptualized and addressed <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2015" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Huq 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptation funding landscape includes various mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and the Rio markers system for tracking adaptation finance. Despite pledges like the “$100 billion promise” and the recent $300 billion commitment at COP29 in Baku (2024), actual disbursement patterns reveal significant shortfalls and geographical and sectoral imbalances <span class="citation" data-cites="stern2022 cpi2023">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-stern2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stern, Songwe, and Bhattacharya 2022</a>; <a href="conclusion.html#ref-cpi2023" role="doc-biblioref">CPI 2023</a>)</span>. These financial frameworks involve complex interactions between public and private financing models, multilateral development banks, bilateral donor frameworks, national governance structures, and non-state actors.</p>
<section id="mitigation" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mitigation"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Mitigation</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Climate mitigation emerged as the first pillar of climate governance, establishing North-South power dynamics through differential responsibilities that would later shape adaptation approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, established climate mitigation as the first pillar of the UNFCCC. The protocol set the goal of keeping greenhouse gas levels below what was deemed dangerous to the biosphere, with emissions reductions primarily assigned to industrialized countries in recognition of their historical responsibility <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. The Kyoto Protocol set legally binding emissions reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and economies in transition, with an average reduction of 5.2% from 1990 levels to be achieved by 2012.</p>
<p>This approach established a key North-South dynamic in climate governance: developed countries would take the lead in emissions reductions, while developing countries were granted space to pursue economic development without binding emissions targets. This differentiation was justified on both historical responsibility for emissions and the principle of equity, recognizing developing countries’ legitimate development needs and lower capacity to reduce emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol also created market mechanisms for carbon trading, called “Flexibility mechanisms,” where emissions could be traded from developing countries to industrialized countries <span class="citation" data-cites="peskett2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-peskett2011" role="doc-biblioref">Peskett, Schreckenberg, and Brown 2011</a>)</span>. These mechanisms included Emissions Trading, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). The CDM in particular became a significant channel for North-South cooperation, allowing developed countries to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries and earn certified emission reduction credits.</p>
<p>Through these mechanisms, developing countries that were under no obligation to cut their emissions could sell carbon credits to industrialized nations with reduction obligations <span class="citation" data-cites="peskett2011">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-peskett2011" role="doc-biblioref">Peskett, Schreckenberg, and Brown 2011</a>)</span>. This approach was designed to reduce the overall costs of meeting mitigation targets while providing sustainable development benefits to host countries. However, the geographic distribution of CDM projects was uneven, with the majority concentrated in larger emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil, while least developed countries, particularly in Africa, hosted relatively few projects.</p>
<p>These patterns revealed how market-based approaches to climate governance could reproduce existing economic disparities rather than challenging them. The concentration of CDM projects in more industrialized developing countries reflected and reinforced global patterns of investment, with the poorest countries largely excluded from participation in carbon markets despite their greater vulnerability to climate impacts <span class="citation" data-cites="dunlap2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-dunlap2018" role="doc-biblioref">Dunlap 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement, adopted at COP21 in 2015, marked a significant shift in the mitigation approach. Rather than maintaining the strict binary between developed and developing country obligations, Paris introduced a universal framework where all countries contribute through “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) while still acknowledging differential capabilities and responsibilities <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. This hybrid approach attempted to resolve long-standing tensions in climate governance by allowing countries to determine their own contributions based on national circumstances while maintaining the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, this flexibility came at the cost of ambition, with the first round of NDCs collectively putting the world on track for approximately 3°C of warming rather than the Agreement’s 1.5-2°C goal. This ambition gap has reinforced critiques that the climate regime prioritizes political feasibility and consensus over the transformative action needed to address the scale of the climate crisis <span class="citation" data-cites="williams2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-williams2020" role="doc-biblioref">Williams 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="adaptation" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adaptation"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Adaptation</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Adaptation evolved from a peripheral concern to a central pillar as climate impacts became unavoidable, creating a distinctive site where North-South relations materialize through funding mechanisms and institutional arrangements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the targets set in the Kyoto protocol proved inadequate to prevent significant climate impacts, and as governments faced resistance to ambitious mitigation measures, climate adaptation gradually gained prominence in the climate regime <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Pelling 2018</a>)</span>. This shift emerged from growing recognition that even with ambitious mitigation efforts, some climate impacts were already occurring and others were inevitable, necessitating organized adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>The development of adaptation within the UNFCCC progressed gradually before its formal establishment as a pillar. Early efforts included the 2001 establishment of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) under the Global Environment Facility, as well as the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol <span class="citation" data-cites="persson2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-persson2014" role="doc-biblioref">Persson and Remling 2014</a>)</span>. These initial funding mechanisms established institutional arrangements that would shape North-South relations in adaptation governance, with developed countries providing finance that developing countries could access through specific procedures and criteria.</p>
<p>The Cancun Adaptation Framework, adopted at COP16 in 2010, formally established adaptation as the second pillar of climate governance. It created several important mechanisms, including the Adaptation Committee to promote coherent implementation of adaptation actions, the process for formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), and approaches to address loss and damage <span class="citation" data-cites="mizuno2024">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mizuno2024" role="doc-biblioref">Mizuno and Okano 2024</a>)</span>. This framework represented a significant step forward in balancing adaptation and mitigation within the climate regime.</p>
<p>Climate adaptation measures vary significantly across contexts. In industrialized countries, adaptation often focuses on managing surface runoff and in low-lying countries, addressing sea-level rise and storm surges through a mix of infrastructure modifications and ecosystem-based approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. However, in developing countries, adaptation intersects with broader development challenges, including poverty reduction, food security, water management, disaster risk reduction, and public health. The boundaries between adaptation and development are often blurred, leading to debates about “adaptation mainstreaming” versus transformative approaches to adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2013" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland and McKinnon 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These different conceptualizations of adaptation reflect underlying North-South dynamics in climate governance. Adaptation in developed countries is typically framed as a technical challenge of adjusting infrastructure and systems to changing climate conditions. In contrast, adaptation in developing countries is often framed within broader development narratives, positioning climate vulnerability as intertwined with development challenges <span class="citation" data-cites="scoville-simonds2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-scoville-simonds2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scoville-Simonds, Jamali, and Hufty 2020</a>)</span>. This framing both reflects and reinforces power dynamics where Northern institutions define what counts as legitimate adaptation and how it should be implemented.</p>
<p>The adaptation funding landscape further materializes North-South relations through specific institutional arrangements and power dynamics. The adaptation financing architecture includes the Adaptation Fund (established under the Kyoto Protocol), the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund, and the Green Climate Fund <span class="citation" data-cites="persson2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-persson2014" role="doc-biblioref">Persson and Remling 2014</a>)</span>. Despite the multiple funding channels, adaptation finance has consistently lagged behind mitigation finance, creating tensions in international negotiations. The Green Climate Fund, established in 2010 and operationalized in 2015, has a mandate to balance its funding between mitigation and adaptation, but has struggled to achieve this balance in practice.</p>
<p>Adaptation funding is further complicated by challenges in defining and measuring adaptation outcomes, attributing climate impacts, and ensuring funds reach the most vulnerable communities <span class="citation" data-cites="persson2014">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-persson2014" role="doc-biblioref">Persson and Remling 2014</a>)</span>. The absence of universally agreed metrics for assessing adaptation effectiveness—unlike mitigation, where greenhouse gas emissions provide a common metric—creates challenges for prioritizing investments and demonstrating results. These measurement challenges are not merely technical but reflect deeper questions about what counts as successful adaptation and who gets to define success.</p>
<p>The adaptation governance landscape is further complicated by its multi-level nature, with actions required at global, regional, national, and local scales. International frameworks provide guidance and resources, but adaptation is inherently context-specific, requiring localized assessment of vulnerabilities and appropriate responses <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2010">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland 2010</a>)</span>. This creates challenges for coherence across scales and for ensuring that global policies and financing mechanisms effectively support local adaptation needs. The tension between global standardization and local specificity reflects broader dynamics in North-South relations, where Northern-dominated international institutions establish frameworks that may not adequately reflect the diverse realities and priorities of communities in the Global South.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Loss and damage represents the recognition that some climate impacts exceed adaptation limits, introducing contested questions of liability and compensation that directly challenge conventional development frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loss and damage emerged as the third pillar of climate governance in recognition that some climate impacts exceed the limits of adaptation, particularly for the most vulnerable nations <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2015" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Huq 2015</a>)</span>. The concept gained prominence in UNFCCC negotiations as new scientific evidence accumulated and activism from small island developing states highlighted that some nations could face existential threats due to sea level rise and other severe climate impacts.</p>
<p>The historical development of loss and damage reveals the contested politics of climate responsibility and liability. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) first proposed an international insurance pool for loss and damage from sea-level rise in 1991, well before the UNFCCC was established <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2015">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2015" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Huq 2015</a>)</span>. However, the concept only gained significant traction two decades later, with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage in 2013, and its subsequent incorporation into Article 8 of the Paris Agreement <span class="citation" data-cites="toussaint2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-toussaint2021" role="doc-biblioref">Toussaint 2021</a>)</span>. This long struggle reflects persistent resistance from developed countries concerned about liability and compensation claims, with the United States in particular insisting on language in the Paris Agreement explicitly stating that Article 8 “does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation” <span class="citation" data-cites="vanhala2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-vanhala2016" role="doc-biblioref">Vanhala and Hestbaek 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Loss and damage is conceptualized in two primary ways, each with distinct implications for North-South relations. First, it can be understood as a form of legal process within domestic courts or under the UNFCCC umbrella. Through this process, damages from a climate-related event are calculated, the contribution of climate change to the event is established, the responsibility for emissions is attributed, and the damages are compensated <span class="citation" data-cites="wallimann-helmer2023">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-wallimann-helmer2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wallimann-Helmer 2023</a>)</span>. This approach draws on principles of international environmental law, particularly the “polluter pays” principle and the concept of state responsibility for transboundary harm.</p>
<p>Climate attribution science has advanced significantly in recent years, with methodologies now able to quantify the extent to which climate change has increased the likelihood or intensity of specific extreme events <span class="citation" data-cites="williams2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-williams2020" role="doc-biblioref">Williams 2020</a>)</span>. This scientific progress strengthens the potential for legal approaches to loss and damage, though significant challenges remain in establishing causation chains from emissions to specific damages and in allocating responsibility among multiple emitters over time.</p>
<p>The second conceptualization frames loss and damage as a form of risk management, where risk is reduced through adaptation measures, transferred through insurance schemes, and retained through resilience measures <span class="citation" data-cites="mechler2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mechler2020" role="doc-biblioref">Mechler et al. 2020</a>)</span>. This approach includes both economic and non-economic losses, with the latter encompassing losses of culture, identity, territory, and indigenous knowledge that cannot be readily monetized. Insurance-based approaches have gained particular traction, with initiatives like the InsuResilience Global Partnership aiming to provide climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions to vulnerable people.</p>
<p>These competing conceptualizations reflect fundamental tensions in North-South relations regarding climate responsibility. The legal/compensation framing directly challenges conventional development frameworks by asserting that historical emitters bear responsibility for climate damages, introducing questions of liability that industrialized countries have consistently resisted <span class="citation" data-cites="vanhala2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-vanhala2016" role="doc-biblioref">Vanhala and Hestbaek 2016</a>)</span>. The risk management framing, while less politically contentious, may depoliticize loss and damage by shifting focus from historical responsibility to technical solutions, potentially reinforcing rather than challenging existing power dynamics.</p>
<p>A breakthrough in loss and damage governance came at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh with the establishment of funding arrangements for loss and damage, followed by the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28 in Dubai <span class="citation" data-cites="janzen2021">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-janzen2021" role="doc-biblioref">Janzen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. These developments represent significant progress, though questions remain about the fund’s size, who contributes, who can access it, and under what circumstances. Initial pledges totaled approximately $700 million—far below estimates of loss and damage costs, which range from $290-580 billion annually by 2030 for developing countries alone.</p>
<p>The evolution of loss and damage governance illustrates how North-South power dynamics shape climate governance even as new institutional arrangements emerge. While developed countries have reluctantly accepted the principle of providing support for loss and damage, they have consistently worked to avoid language around compensation or liability that could create legal obligations based on historical emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Pelling 2018</a>)</span>. Meanwhile, vulnerable countries continue to advocate for frameworks that acknowledge historical responsibility and provide predictable, adequate finance for addressing loss and damage.</p>
<p>These tensions are not merely rhetorical but have material consequences for how loss and damage is addressed and funded. The framing of loss and damage as either a matter of justice and compensation or as a technical challenge of risk management shapes which interventions are prioritized, how resources are allocated, and ultimately who bears the costs of climate impacts that cannot be avoided through mitigation or adaptation <span class="citation" data-cites="vanhala2016">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-vanhala2016" role="doc-biblioref">Vanhala and Hestbaek 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>UNFCCC adaptation negotiations reveal fundamental tensions between technical framing and justice concerns, with ambiguous language and procedural complexity often masking power imbalances in how adaptation is conceptualized and funded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UNFCCC understands climate damages, all the negative effects of climate change, as a kind of spillover effect. Unmitigated emissions lead to damages, unadapted damages causes losses that have to be compensated. Since the UNFCCC, like most international agreements, is negotiated by countries that have to balance their need for strong policy action and future uncertainty, the process is ambiguous <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. This ambiguity manifests in deliberately vague language that can accommodate divergent interpretations, allowing countries with different positions to claim the agreement supports their view.</p>
<p>UNFCCC negotiations involve complex interactions between different country groupings with varying interests and capabilities. These include the G77 and China (representing over 130 developing countries), the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), the European Union, the Umbrella Group (including the US, Japan, Australia and others), and the Environmental Integrity Group <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>. These coalitions provide developing countries with greater negotiating power than they would have individually, though the diverse interests within groups like the G77 can create internal tensions.</p>
<p>The dynamics within these negotiations reflect broader power imbalances in the international system. Technical complexity, language barriers, delegation size disparities, and limited institutional capacity create challenges for many developing countries, despite formal procedural equality <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Pelling 2018</a>)</span>. Civil society organizations often provide technical support to vulnerable country delegations, while also using various forms of advocacy to influence the negotiation process. The private sector, particularly fossil fuel industries, also exercises significant influence, both through direct lobbying and by shaping national positions of major economies.</p>
<p>Many see the relationship between climate action and economic growth as opposites, resisting binding agreements and preferring unsubstantiated goals. This tension often manifests in debates over the scale and nature of economic transformation required to address climate change effectively. Economic analyses have traditionally framed climate policy as imposing costs that must be weighed against the benefits of avoided damages, with models typically showing modest optimal carbon prices that increase gradually over time <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-hall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hall and Persson 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Convention has room for multiple interpretations of most aspects of it, and there are two main ways of understanding the relation between the pillars. The first one is that the goal is to <em>minimize the damage</em> as much as possible by mitigating as much as possible, and that adaptation and loss and damage are there as a safety precaution. This perspective, often advanced by developed countries and mainstream economic analyses, emphasizes maximizing mitigation efforts to reduce the need for adaptation and loss and damage measures.</p>
<p>The second is that there exists an <em>optimal combination of mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage</em> that uses the resources more efficiently. This view, grounded in economic efficiency logic, suggests balancing investments across all three pillars based on cost-benefit analyses that consider the marginal returns to different types of climate action <span class="citation" data-cites="mechler2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-mechler2020" role="doc-biblioref">Mechler et al. 2020</a>)</span>. It recognizes that some level of climate change is already unavoidable, making adaptation necessary regardless of mitigation efforts, and that in some cases, adaptation may be more cost-effective than extremely expensive mitigation options.</p>
<p>This economically-oriented framing has been criticized for several reasons. First, it tends to obscure questions of justice and equity by focusing narrowly on aggregate costs and benefits without adequate attention to their distribution. Second, it struggles to account for non-economic values, including cultural heritage, biodiversity, and human lives, that cannot be readily monetized. Third, it typically applies high discount rates that effectively devalue future impacts, raising intergenerational equity concerns <span class="citation" data-cites="williams2020">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-williams2020" role="doc-biblioref">Williams 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond these economic frameworks, some scholars and activists argue for rights-based or justice-oriented approaches that prioritize the needs and perspectives of those most vulnerable to climate impacts, regardless of economic efficiency calculations <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts2018">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-roberts2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts and Pelling 2018</a>)</span>. These approaches emphasize historical responsibility for emissions, procedural justice in decision-making, and recognition of diverse values and knowledge systems.</p>
<p>Indigenous perspectives offer yet another framing that often emphasizes relationships, reciprocity, and responsibilities to future generations and non-human beings. These approaches typically involve more holistic understandings of climate change that situate it within broader patterns of colonialism, extraction, and disruption of Indigenous relationships with lands and waters <span class="citation" data-cites="ireland2013">(<a href="conclusion.html#ref-ireland2013" role="doc-biblioref">Ireland and McKinnon 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These diverse perspectives on the relationship between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage reflect broader tensions in climate governance between technocratic approaches that seek optimal policy designs and more political approaches that emphasize power, justice, and competing values. The integration of these three pillars continues to evolve, with ongoing debates about their proper balance, financing, and implementation. As climate impacts intensify and the window for limiting warming to 1.5°C narrows, these discussions take on increasing urgency within and beyond the UNFCCC process.</p>
